These bitches don't like me
These bitches wanna fight me
And doin' shit just to spite me
I see them talking on the IG
Think you jealous, maybe high key
I got the juice, I got the Hi-C
Do I care? Unlikely

You must have time on your hands
'Cause all the time you been hatin'
I know you're mad that I'm famous
I know you're mad that I made it
When all the time you been hatin'
You could've turned into something
Sometimes it works out for people
Sometimes it really just doesn't
Don't do this shit to be famous
I do this shit 'cause I love it
I shot an arrow said, "Fuck it"
I took a chance, came from nothing
You have to go for it, want it
You have to rise up above it
If you go on expecting
Well girl, I think that you're buggin'
How you want what I have?
You ain't workin' yourself
That toxic energy shit
Ain't really good for your health
I think you need better goals
'Cause, oh my God, you seem lost
You talkin' shit 'bout my music
But what the fuck have you dropped?
Now what the fuck have you done?
Accolades, you have none
Your lazy ways get you none
I'll go and pray for you, hun

I'm on the train throwing soup
The racist men making threats
I'm not a gangster, but I can tell you I love to throw hands
On racists, bigots and scum
I don't like drama, it's dumb
I don't be fightin' no women
I don't be totin no guns
I hate domestic abusers
In fact, they all make me sick
This dude poured wine on my friend
I punched him straight in his shit
I got a real code of honor that I take seriously
If Colin Kaep' was a woman then I'd be dead on one knee
My revolution is soulful
I'm healing kids with my hands
I'm talkin' loving my people
Not fightin' bitches for bands
I got no hate in my heart
I think it's funny I rap
I did not bang in these streets
And I did not trap in the trap
