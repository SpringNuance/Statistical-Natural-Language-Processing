I'm not like those baddies that you see on Instagram (Preach it)
I'm not like those girls that be on Kanye "Workout Plan"
I'm a little artsy and I know I'm kinda smart (Church it)
I may not have clout, but I've got a lot of heart (Say what)
I don't do no flexing, I don't do it for the 'Gram
I don't need approval, not from you or any man
I don't need attention, I don't care if I look broke
Inside I am beautiful, and that is all I know (Preach it)
Even when I'm confident, I'm kind of insecure
Use a lot of filters when I'm not feeling for sure (Church it)
Compare myself to other girls, the pressure got me stressed
I hate social media, I wish it all would end (Say what)
I'm not like those other girls, in fact, I'm fucking worse
I like being different, wouldn't change it for the world (Go 'head)
Everything I'm not makes me everything I am
Inside I am beautiful, and this is who I am (On God)
