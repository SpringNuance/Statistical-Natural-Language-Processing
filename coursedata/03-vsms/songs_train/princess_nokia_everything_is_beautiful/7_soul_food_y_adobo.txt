You need to season your chicken
We ain't like them folks in here
Sometimes you fight with the Bible
Sometimes it's cowrie and shells
This family kicking up bells
I celebrate 'cause I'm well
I thank the Lord 'cause it's sunny
And I wish enemies well

I love that soul food, adobo
A little mixed with sancocho
That mashed up plantain mofongo
That arroz, chicken, and pollo
I pour libations in soil
It's three leches and Goya
It's the leftovers in Tupperware
And the plates left in foil

That cuchifrito papito
That styrofoam with the juice
I pass that Leo 150
That cha-cha, Timbaland boot
I'm in the Bronx with the mamis
That's wearing Chanel, Versace
They carry bags, Tamagotchi
And everybody a chapi
That salsa music be blastin'
That Orchard Beach with the nutty
Bacardi mixed with the rum
That barbecue come with Henny
And City Island for seafood
You crack a 'Wood in the whip
You grab a piña colada
You take a number and sit
You hit the park in the summer
That public pool in July
You bring your lock and your towel
And Vaseline if you fight
I came with my family
My cousins, uncles, and aunts
The sun had set 'cross the sun
We made it back to the block
That colored syrup that's red
That sugar cane and that ice
That fake and sugary blue
The taste of liquid, that's nice
That gold chain necklace and hoop
That messy bun with the swoop
That baby hair on ya shorty
The prettiest girl in school
That Café Bustelo
With milk and sugar to mellow
Know some Caribbean fellows
That get you pregnant by hello
That baby shower, that party
That quinceañera get started
The titis got you, don't worry
So don't you leave in a hurry

I love that soul food, adobo
A little mixed with sancocho
That mashed up plantain mofongo
That arroz, chicken, and pollo
I pour libations in soil
It's three leches and Goya
It's the leftovers in Tupperware
And the plates left in foil
