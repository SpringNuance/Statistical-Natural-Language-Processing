I am Gemini, super fly, fly guy
I am Gemini, two heads, one eye
I am Gemini, like Pac, André, Lauryn
And Kanye, Boy George, and Anne Frank
I am Gemini, but no, I'm not fake
I am Gryffindor, but don’t move like snake
I am Gemini, people love to call me crazy
But they judging, and they hating, and I'm too grown for explaining
I am Gemini, June 14th
And all the famous rappers got a sign like me
And all the famous rappers got a heart like me
But I know that I'm different and they’re not quite me
I'm the horoscope ho, I'm the planet and moon
I'm the rising ascendant, fifth degree to the Moon
I'm the witch of your dreams, I'm the voice in your head
Your husband sent me a DM and I just left him on read
My planet's Mercury, my element is air
I'm such a free spirit that I don’t fucking care
If I got a blunt I ain’t moving out my chair
You can kiss my derrière 'cause it’s shaped like a pear

Little zodiac, ginger snap
Pretty little shorty with the snapback
Tarot deck, Ankh set
Like to get her feet wet with Keith Sweat
The freaknik, from Harlem to BX
I clean up like Kleenex
Spinelli, I'm recess, kickball to the deep end
The public school era, it's old-school forever
The moon and the tides really control the weather
The sun and the moon, yes, it do go together
A spiritual being that rides any weather

Riders on the storm, riders on the storm
Yes, I'm on my own, tryna find up my home
Riders on the storm, riders on the storm
Always on my own, tryna find up a home

Intelligent, adaptable, agile, communicative
Informative, creative, and everybody hates it
Imagination colorful and I just entertain it
A poet and a dreamer, I’ma seize the world and take it
Of course, there is the bad, I'm really superficial
I ain't called you in three months, still I maintain that I miss you
A Gemini with issues, social, isolated
I pray that I'ma make it or at least that I can fake it
And like a Gemini, I'm really prone to changes
I'm really indecisive and I really fuckin' hate it
Picking food or picking clothes, it always make me anxious
But thank God I'm androgynous, 'cause boys clothes what I stay in

Riders on the storm, riders on the storm
Yes, I'm on my own, tryna find up my home
Riders on the storm, riders on the storm
Always on my own, tryna find up a home
