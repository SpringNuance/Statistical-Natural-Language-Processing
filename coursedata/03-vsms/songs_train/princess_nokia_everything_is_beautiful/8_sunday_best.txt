Couple Sunday dresses, it's a holy Sunday best
Witches get the brunching, rep that five upon the chest
Penetrate my coven, guaranteed you will be vexed
VIP to Heaven, Yemaya upon the breast
Mother love, sister love
Daughter love, all the love
Conjure love and give me love
God's love, super love
Yeah, Gaia love, all love
Yeah, we holding all the love

Repping 256
Osunfikayo, really do this shit
Oloyi Ayo Ore Yeye ooo
Our mother, source of our creative flow
Uh, we are Divine Feminine
The ancient waters that exist within
Don't forget your truth, melanin
All you got to do is look within
Then you'll recollect where you begin
And we pray everyday
Osetura, yeah, we got that Ase
Put respect on the name
Iya, Nana, Bruja, best in the game

For my santeras with candelas
Taking baths with la canela
Oshun make things better
For my brujas, sucia women who don't fold
Head wrapped in cotton and covered with gold
I run with wolves, leader of the pack
I frolic in the woods with the Stevie Nicks hat

Yo, Nokia that's a fact
Hunnid goons on my back
And they really pave ways
Put my prayers on wax
Eleyeleye aro, lo dega
I bet y'all want to meet my mom
But you can't yet, yeah
Sorry, had to raincheck
Had to freeze the time, read your mind
I ain't brain dead
I can feel your vibe, and it's toxic and hateful
Low frequency, bottom of the basement
I can transmute you, I can make you fruitful
I could fill your cup, mami got that omi tutu
See you in a rut, baby, come here, let me soothe you
I could build a trust, send you blessings on the Bluetooth
That juju

I'm a white witch and I wear a lot of black
It's a full moon and I'm praying back-to-back
Use my intuition, set my new intention
My future's abundant, joyful, pleasant
Bohemian boricua, Gypsy señorita
Jíbara of the finca, bonita 'e la isla
Like Stevie Nicks, I got a hat full of tricks
You would think I move bricks from the money that I get

Let the river flow, hey
If you feel the soul (Feel the soul)
This is spiritual (This is spiritual)

But don't get it fucked up
You could get fucked up
I'll defend my family and my spirit 'til I'm done up
This the revolution like a Panther with her gun up
I don't endorse the violence, but you ain't about to son us
I promise
Omosun, omo awo
On the high road
Walk through all the right doors
Crown to the floor
I make ose on tour
I inspire young girls
All around the world

If you ain't 'bout it
You can miss me with the bullsh—
Oshun and Nokia, we really do this
Me and my blood with the blueprint
If you ain't 'bout it
You can miss me with the bullsh—
Oshun and Nokia, we really do this
Me and my blood with the blueprint
