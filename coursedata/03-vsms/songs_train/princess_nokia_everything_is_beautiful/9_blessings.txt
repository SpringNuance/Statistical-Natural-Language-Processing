God is testing me but I won't lose
I had to come back with that new groove
I had to say goodbye to my old dude
'Cause he ain't really is who he told you
I might take a loss but I'm stepping
I need to work hard for these blessings
These blessings on blessings on blessings
Teach me lessons on lessons on lessons
Pain is temporary and is over
Throw some dead weight off my shoulder
Yeah

God is testing me but I won't lose
Had to come back with that new groove
I had to say goodbye to my old dude
'Cause he ain't really is what he told you
I might take a loss but I'm stepping
I need to work hard for my blessings
Be righteous and blessings on blessings
Teach me lessons on lessons on lessons
Pain is temporary and is over
Throw some dead weight off my shoulder

I'ma be like, "I told ya"
I'ma be like, "I told ya"
These blessings on blessings on blessings
I know I won't be forgetting
I know that I won't be forgetting
Look at me now, look at the style
Look at the crowd, look how I wow
Look at the stage and I bow
Look at the things that I know that I'm proud
Yeah, look at my style, look at me now
Look at the crowd, look at that, wow
Look at the stage, then I bow
Look at the things that I do and I'm proud
People talking shit, yeah, that's old news
I'm the topic of their whole crew
Me by myself is a whole mood
Don't speak my name, I don't know you
Grown folk business, abundant in riches
Don't fuck with you bitches, you acting suspicious
The fuck out my mentions, you hoes get no mentions
I got no emotion, you got no attention
Leave hoes here second-guessing
I'm just here counting blessings
You wish you had my essence
But you just here taking seconds
Sips tea, I'm minding business
My mind is on my business
And I'm always doing business
You sleeping with the fishes, honey
'Cause business full of winnings
And I get it how I get it
I'ma make you all regret it
I'ma count up all the fetti
Smoking on an earthly lettuce
This green is like a fetish
And my life is just like heaven

I am that ocean daughter and I be repping that seven
I am that honey daughter, I be repping that five
You think your magic worked on me?
Well, girl, I think that's a lie
I pray no weapon prosper against me
Pray and shut my eyes
I am that ocean daughter, I be repping that second
I am that ocean daughter, I be repping that five
You think your magic worked on me? Well, girl, it's a lie
I pray no weapon prosper, I pray, I shut my eyes
You cast manipulation, I cast the light inside

All up in my Kool-Aid
You don't even know the flavor
Go and mind your business
Save the goofiness for later
I've been humble too long
I've been sitting on these songs
