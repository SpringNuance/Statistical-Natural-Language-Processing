Green eggs & ham
Sam, I am
I'm the man
With the plan
Toast and jam
Sunny D
You and me
Socks on feet

Love my inner child, Kool-Aid smile
I been like this for a while
Going into town, gonna find a crowd
Right by the kids in the park with the style
Swing 'til it's dark, hit the block
Run from cops, don't get knocked
By these opps, fuck these cops
Fuck these cops, fuck these cops
Looking for the fun, can you blame me?
Like to make jokes, but they think that I'm crazy
I know that I'm perfect the way God had made me
And I thank my parents for the life they gave me
Have you told your parents that you loved them lately?
I look like my mama in the 1980's
If I been bad, well, please forgive me
I remember when my granny used to hit me
Public school and two Thanksgivings
Purple corduroys with the matching ribbon
Lil' puffy jacket and the T-shirt gilded

Wake up in the morning
Look into the fridge
Grab some eggs out
Breakfast it is
I'm still a kid, but kids are fun
Nice cup of OJ, orange and sun

Frying pan in my hand
Green eggs and some ham
Yes, I'm Sam, I am
Yes, I'm Sam, I am
