Splish-splash, double bubble bath
Riff raff, double C's on the dash
Big bands, got the P's and the cash
New dance, baby, lead me by the hand
Drip-drop, wavy like a mermaid
Take a sip now, 'cause these bitches actin' thirsty
I'm special, you ain't on my level
Looking back now, we could never be together

Hey, bitch, I'm wavy
Bitch, I'm wavy
Hey, bitch, I'm wavy
Bitch, I'm wavy
Hey, bitch, I'm wavy
Bitch, I'm wavy
Hey, bitch, I'm wavy
Bitch, I'm wavy

I'm boasy, yeah, I'm the shit
I'm a pimp and a ho, I could take your bitch
So what? I got an attitude, now fuck what you think
That's a neck roll, and a hair toss, bitch, I'm stank
I'm a whole mood
Yeah, I'm a vibe
I'm a 10, babe
Right there you a five
And what's my type now?
Don't you ask me
I'm expensive
Bitch, I'm fancy

Hey, bitch, I'm wavy
Bitch, I'm wavy
Hey, bitch, I'm wavy
Bitch, I'm wavy
Hey, bitch, I'm wavy
Bitch, I'm wavy
Hey, bitch, I'm wavy
Bitch, I'm wavy

You see, I got that tsunami, and I'm watching Toonami
And I'm eating wasabi with a side of umami
It's a lot of anime, Hayao Miyazaki
Papi looking Dominican, man, he got the salami
Now he calling me, "Mami", and he giving me toppy
I'm surpassing your ass, and I know that you saw me
Climbing up on the ladder, see my ass getting fatter
Getting bigger and better, go tell your friends that you had her

Hey, bitch, I'm wavy
Bitch, I'm wavy
Hey, bitch, I'm wavy
Bitch, I'm wavy
Hey, bitch, I'm wavy (You can't fuck with me)
Bitch, I'm wavy
Hey, bitch, I'm wavy (You can't fuck with me)
Bitch, I'm wavy

You can't fuck with me
