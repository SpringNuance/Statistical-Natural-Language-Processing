Wash and set, pay the rent
Wonder where all my money's spent
College debt, I am stressed
Tell me who gonna pay this next
Tell me who gonna pay these debts
Tell me who gonna get these checks
I miss being a kid

Duck, duck, goose, tie my shoes
Reds and blues, picture room
Coloring books, bells and hooks
Fortune tellers, truth and darers
Cafeteria and the school yard
Sitting on the rug with the guitar
Scratch 'n sniff, scratch 'n sniff
Ripping off a bandage
Growing up sucks, I don't wanna do it
I'ma run away, okay, well, screw it
Make it one day with my music
I ain't been in school, they say I'm truant

Tax returns, need to learn this
Growing up fucking sucks, shit
Tax returns, need to learn this
Growing up fucking sucks, shit

Got a blunt in my hand
Got some good in my heart
Got the stars in my eyes
Got some plans for this art
Got some things I wanna say
And some things I hold back
Got some tears I done cried
From the pain that I had
I been faking since young
I been holding it in
God, stroke me on the chin
Tell me I'm gonna win
I miss being a kid

Wash and set, pay the rent
Wonder where all my money's spent
College debt, I am stressed
Tell me who gonna pay this next
Tell me who gonna pay these debts
Tell me who gonna get these checks

I miss being a kid (I miss being a kid)
