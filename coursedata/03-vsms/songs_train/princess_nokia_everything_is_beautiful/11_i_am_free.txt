No ego, no ego, no ego
No people, no people, no people
Let me go, let me go, let me go
And I am free, and I am free
And I am free, and I am free
(No ego, no ego, no ego)

Let me tell you about me
Me, myself, and I
Kicking back with the homies
All we do is get high
Ain't nobody here phony
Weirdo shit don't fly
Don't you talk down on me
You could get punched in your eye
I am not here for my image
I'm not here to sell you gimmicks
Just want you to hear my lyrics
Feel my vibe and feel my spirit
In my heart is something different
I've been changing, it's apparent
I am focused on my healing
Sometimes I feel like I'm screaming
I've got angels, I've got demons
And I keep them so well hidden
I've been praying to get stronger
Go the distance, take me longer
I'm talking to my God, yes, it's righteous
And everything is fine bless, is fine bless
I blow the trees with no stress, I focus
I'm getting back to oldest, the oldest

No ego, no ego, no ego
No people, no people, no people
Let me go, let me go, let me go
And I am free, and I am free
And I am free, and I am free
(No ego, no ego, no ego)

I've been letting go, I've been blowing off some smoke
I've been climbing up the stairwell, Heaven, coming back from Hell
Like the Ring, Girl from the Well, I was put under a spell
I had lost myself a little, had my heart locked in a cell
Now I open up my soul, give you heart, and teeth, and bones
And my heart is all exposed, from my mistakes and my woes
Woman, I am strong, woman, I do belong
Woman, I take the hate, and, yes, I make into a song
How many times I fall? How many do I get up?
You think opinions matter, but I just don't give a fuck
Crazier than the weather, unwavering like the sea
Impulsive like a fire, but my roots was made from trees
The blessing from He, straight from God
I pray for enemies, but please don't think that I forgot

No ego, no ego, no ego
No people, no people, no people
Let me go, let me go, let me go
And I am free, and I am free
And I am free, and I am free
(No ego, no ego, no ego)
