I'm cold, they hot, I'm everything they not
Ain't worried 'bout no spot, 'cause when I drop, the whole world stop
I got the music locked, for girls in twisted locs
Who like they body hair and buy consignment shop
Art thot, that's me, I dance, I rap, I sing
I do so many things, I move around these P's
I like to move with ease, I'm staying drama-free
Get to that happy peak, get to that happy peak
Crop you out the picture, I ain't fucking with ya
Listening to SZA, Hennessy in my pitcher
Power my liver, get the food delivered
Cold like a shiver, cake, I'll take a sliver
Vegan, please, get the cheese, got my ex on his knees
Might just say he hate me, but he come right back to me
I'm not like them kids, they cool and I'm not
Ten chains full of bling, one nose full with snot
I got my happy place, and it's all in my head
And when I close my eyes, I go to it instead
I'm getting Wonder Bread, I keep that lettuce fresh
I'm writing from my bed, this joy will never end

I see they mad 'cause I'm a lady
They rolling Backwoods, I roll Mercedes
I'm never mad, that's why they hate me
Sheneneh Jenkins, don't you try to play me

You acting outta pocket, well, bitch, you need to stop it
'Cause everything you doing is fully microscopic
Your name is not the topic, and you gets no attention
I'm Snow White in the forest, and the dwarves is my henchmen
Petty's never cute, growing up is cool
Bitches still be acting like they fighting after school
Fighting is your mood, hungry, you need food
I'm out here cool as shit, dressed like I'm in Krush Groove
