Insects crawlin' on my window
On my jacket too
Fishnet stockings ripped real thin
Dirty sneakers too
Graveyard girl, I'm your leader
Walk around with me
See the weirdo things I'm into
Things that's make believe
The anomaly, 21st century
All the space between
Paved, the streets are mean
People got their agendas
That's okay with me
They're all hooked up to their programs
But I will be set free

I've got space and time on my mind
I've got bigger things to do
I've got voices in my head
They're exploding with the truth
The anomaly, oh, oh, oh
The anomaly, oh, oh
The anomaly, anomaly, anomaly
Oh, oh, the anomaly, anomaly, anomaly
Oh, oh, oh

Listen, I don't get political
Government reform, that'll be a miracle
Bloody hands of the government
I think it's time that they get a punishment
Walkin' 'round like zombies
Stitches in their face
Walkin' 'round with ya head cut off
But I know my place
See, I know your secrets
Which ones will I tell?
Tried to hold me in a cage
I'm bound to expel

I've got space and time on my mind
I've got bigger things to do
I've got voices in my head
They're exploding with the truth
The anomaly, oh, oh, oh
The anomaly, oh, oh
The anomaly, anomaly, anomaly
Oh, oh, the anomaly, anomaly, anomaly
Oh, oh
