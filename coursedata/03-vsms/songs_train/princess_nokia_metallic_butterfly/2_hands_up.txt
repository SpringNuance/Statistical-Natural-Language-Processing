Hands up
Baby boy, you got this
I don't wanna fight now
We don't speak the same language
You left me with my heart broke
Body full of anguish
Now we gettin' violent
I'm cursing out in Spanish
I'm trying really hard, see
To finish what we had started
You see, I had some plans now
Don't want to be departed
But you and me are stubborn
Try to outdo one another
Fighting with each other
When we should love one another

Hands up
