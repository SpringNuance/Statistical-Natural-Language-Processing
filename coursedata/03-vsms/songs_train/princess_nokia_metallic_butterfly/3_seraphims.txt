Seraphims cover me with their night wings
Wonder why I must feel so complete
Feeling these angels all around me
Heaven on Earth is where you found me
Seraphims kiss the tip of my nose
All of the pain, I’ve seem to let go
I guess I'm gonna stay in your heavenly gaze

Angels kiss my face
Angels kiss my face

Time and time again
I started wars in the heads of men
I am a woman, I do not break, I bend
I'm sent to heal, angels are real
In a world of steel

Two butterflies sitting in my hair
Two butterflies sitting in my bed
Two butterflies sitting in my hair
Two butterflies sitting in my bed

Seraphims cover me with their night wings
Wonder why I must feel so complete
Feeling these angels all around me
Heaven on Earth is where you found me
Seraphims kiss the tip of my nose
All of the pain, I’ve seem to let go
I guess I'm gonna stay in your heavenly gaze

Time and time again
I started wars in the heads of men
I am a woman, I do not break, I bend
I'm sent to heal, angels are real
In a world of steel
