She's like a biohazard and you have to have her
And you try to snatch her but you can't even catch her
Butterfly, butter-butterfly
You can't contain her so you try to break her
But you cannot shake her, she ain't no faker
She don't wear no chain, play no game
Refuse to be a slave to a romance rage

Biohazard butterfly
Flying through polluted sky
Flying through space and time
Biohazard butterfly
Flying through polluted sky
Flying through space and time

Don't abuse the muse, 'cause art the one they use
The butterfly's too good
And she deserves better, and when you did her wrong
You started off the ticking bomb
She's young in age but knows her sage
She knows a page or two from the book of the luck
Destroy even the baddest hook
She puts a good fight, escaping in the night to do what's right
Sweet little child, who daydreams of suicide
Don't cry a little, gumdrop eyes
You'd be surprised who will demise
The chosen poison, she's sweet when she's unnoticed
To the sky, she is the closest
She don't consort with mortals
She don't consort with mortals

Biohazard butterfly
Flying through polluted sky
Flying through space and time
Biohazard butterfly
Flying through polluted sky
Flying through space and time
