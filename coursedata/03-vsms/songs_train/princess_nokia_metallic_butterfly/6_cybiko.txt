I'm the fantasy of reality
Click, click, click, do what I please
Hit me on my Sidekick, never been a side chick
Always been a wifey, never been a side bitch
Oh, it's a Princess ting
The age of 14, I was wearin' rings
Makin' Xanga things with my Dell PC
Memorizing codes was so amazing
HTML in my sleep
Binary codes, breakfast I eat
Poor and sexy girls are the dreams that I dream
And this is the life of 2014
Invisible cage of the MySpace age
Hooked on for hours, plays for plays
Digital rage is my digital sage
Digital junk go page for page

Confessions of a cyber girl
Escapin' out the Matrix world
It's a war and I'm winnin'
Let me live the life I did in the beginning
Confessions of a cyber girl
Escapin' out the Matrix world
It's a war and I'm winnin'
Let me live the life I did in the beginning
Let me live the life I did in the beginning
Let me live the life I did in the beginning
Let me live the life I did in the beginning
Let me live the life I did in the beginning
Let me live the life I did in the beginning
Let me live the life I did in the beginning

A little bitch, hella fuckin' weirdo
Awkward in the club and I whisper in your earlobe
Read my books, and I don't do drugs
Like a mother's love, I'm silly and disturbed
Thinking too much, and I live in the Matrix
Understand the truth and I see different phases
Dimensions that ain't even mentioned
I could fly to space anytime, no question
If I try hard, I can move it with my mind
Finna meditate until I gravitate
Get my living state into a higher place
Stay the fuck up and I think it's true
I'm still a little brat, sayin' "Don't tell me what to do"
Boo, this is just my life
And what you went through, I been through it twice
I'm still doin' nice, I'll be the damn statistic

Givin' it my all, it's a gamble, I'ma risk it
(Gamble, I'ma risk it, gamble, I'ma risk it)
Givin' it my all, it's a gamble, I'ma risk it
(Gamble, I'ma risk it, gamble, I'ma risk it
Gamble, I'ma risk it, gamble, I'ma risk it
Gamble, I'ma risk it, gamble, I'ma risk it
Gamble, I'ma risk it, gamble, I'ma risk it
Gamble, I'ma risk it, gamble, I'ma risk it
Gamble, I'ma risk it, gamble, I'ma risk it
Gamble, I'ma risk it, gamble, I'ma risk it
Gamble, I'ma risk it, gamble, I'ma risk it)
