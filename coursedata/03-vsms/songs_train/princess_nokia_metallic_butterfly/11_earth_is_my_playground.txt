Higher and higher, higher and higher
Higher and higher, higher and, higher and
Higher and higher, higher and higher
Higher and higher, higher and, higher and
Higher and higher, higher and higher
Higher and higher, higher and, higher and
Higher and higher, higher and higher
Higher and higher, higher and, higher and

Use my imagination
To travel to other places
And I smile at all their faces
That I've never ever seen
I travel so far
That I never need a car
When I'm close to shooting stars
It's the best I'll ever be

I run with colors in my hair, colors in my hair
I run with colors in my hair, colors in my hair

I wanna run free
I wanna stay long
I wanna be me
Is that something wrong?

Earth is my playground
Stars are my sea
Earth is my playground
Do you wanna play with me?
Find a place you can call home
I fell in love with the universe

A place you can call your own
I'm floating through the universe

I wanna run free
I wanna stay long
I wanna be me
Is that something wrong?

Don't you know?
I fly away to another place
Where no one bothers me
And honestly, I prefer Earth
To a lot of other places
(I wanna run free)
I go higher and higher (Higher and higher)
'Til I can't feel anything
(I wanna run free)
I go higher and higher (Higher and higher)
To the place where angels sing
