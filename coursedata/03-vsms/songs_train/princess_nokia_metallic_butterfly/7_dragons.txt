My moon, my life
My stars, my sun
You are the sweetest song
My king at night
I wanna look you in the eye
My moon, my moon, my sun

And break the chains of what remains, I'd like to
And stop the pain of endless game, I had to

A promise for a man
A royal, royal man
And you are just that man to me
Have no qualms playing in your arms
You kept me with your toothless charm
You're so funny, weird and strong
Let's make babies and grow on a farm
I like you so much that it doesn't even hurt
(Doesn't even hurt, doesn't even hurt
Doesn't even hurt, doesn't even hurt)

And break the chains of what remains, I'd like to
And stop the pain of endless game, I had to

We can have tea, talk about things that are exciting
You can buy me bling, I'll wear your ring
You wear my chain, I like your sting (I like your sting)
I'll just take you to lunch
We can have tea, talk about things that are exciting
You can make me bling, wear your ring
You wear my chain, I like your sting (I like your sting)
I like your sting, I like your sting, I like your sting
We can have tea, talk about things that are exciting
You can buy me bling, I'll wear your ring
You wear my chain, I like your sting
We can have tea, talk about things that are exciting
Buy me fake bling, I'll wear your ring
You wear my chain, I like your sting (I like your sting)
Mother of dragons, you are my sun
There's a place in my heart that you already won
(You already won, you already won)
Mother of dragons, you are my sun
There's a place in my heart that you already won
(You already won, you already won)

And break the chains of what remains, I'd like to
And stop the pain of endless game, I had to
