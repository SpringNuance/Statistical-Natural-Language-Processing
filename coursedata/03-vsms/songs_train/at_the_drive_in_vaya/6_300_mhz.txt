In the unlikely event that sarcasm is an unfitting dress
Amnesia proletariat, amnesia proletariat
Coughing up the coffins, cotton candy coated teeth
The reflection of your enamel, made no reflection in our mirror

Malfunction, malfunction

These pockets were clinching, all filled with fists
These decibels were rotted in the canals of my teeth
Amnesia proletariat, amnesia proletariat
Sharpened on the fucking hides of men
In the full of this moon we will make amends

Malfunction, malfunction
Malfunction, malfunction

Whispered in the ear, three hundred megahertz
Megahertz

Your enamel made no reflection in our mirror
Coughing up the coffins, cotton candy coated teeth
Amnesia proletariat
In the unlikely event that sarcasm is an unfitting dress
Amnesia proletariat, amnesia proletariat, amnesia
Coughing up the coffins, cotton candy coated teeth
These pockets were clinching, all filled with teeth
Sharpened on the fucking hides of men

Whispered in the ear, three hundred megahertz
Megahertz
