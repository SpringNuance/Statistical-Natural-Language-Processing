This is forgiven if the uniform fits
Postponed, at the first showing
This is the tension mold of frozen icicles
And it feels like it's snowing

You speak in tongues
Tremors that warn us of ourselves
(Walk away)
Born in hearts, etched in cold
At the first showing

Nothing bleeds the same, my travel expense paid
Postponed, at the first showing
This dance is out of rhythm, we trip on excess steps
Postponed, at the first showing

You speak in tongues
Tremors that warn us of ourselves
(Walk away)
Born in hearts, etched in cold
At the first showing

Born in hearts, yet etched in cold
Swingsets pay the playground toll
Tremors that hold us
Tremors that warn us
Nothing bleeds like
Tremors that hold us
Tremors that warn us
Nothing bleeds like
Tremors that hold us
Tremors that warn us
Nothing bleeds like
Tremors that hold us
Tremors that warn us
Nothing bleeds like
Nothing bleeds like

(Walk away)
Born in hearts, etched in cold
At the first showing
(Walk away)
Born in hearts, etched in cold
