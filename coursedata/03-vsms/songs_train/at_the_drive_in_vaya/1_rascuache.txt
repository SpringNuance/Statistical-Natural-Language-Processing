Fences with switches - turn them on
The moats of your homes, poured salt on these slugs
Mugshot, fatigue
Shimmering

Pacemaker pace yourself
You were slowly clawing your way out, slowly, slowly
Pacemaker pace yourself
You were slowly clawing your way out

Tourniquet of gossip on a board of checkered chess
Salt ring, probing, in case of emergency
Stampede is coming, mastodon infantry
Radiate this frequency and show me just what the hell you mean

Pacemaker pace yourself
You were slowly clawing your way out
Pacemaker pace yourself
You were slowly clawing your way out
Pacemaker pace yourself
You were slowly clawing your way out

Here comes the bride, here comes the bride
Lavender and smothered in black turpentine

Pacemaker pace yourself
You were slowly clawing your way out
Pacemaker pace yourself
You were slowly clawing your way out
Pacemaker pace yourself
You were slowly clawing your way out
Pacemaker pace yourself
You were slowly clawing your way out
