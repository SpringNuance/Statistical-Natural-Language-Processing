Beneath the residue of film
Beneath the chemicals that the picture spilled
The ouija board had spelled its name
In tiki torches set aflame

Taking rations from the ballot box
Cursing like SweeTarts, cursing like SweeTarts
Increase the dosage, count back from ten
Increase the dosage, count back from ten

And it was written down
Touching Earth in a capital faunt
Heat-seeking, gums bleeding
Fingers snapping at the catacomb stabbings

Taking rations from the ballot box
Cursing like SweeTarts, cursing like SweeTarts
"Adhesive," she said, "don't stick to me"
"Adhesive," she said, "please don't stick to me"
"Adhesive," she said, "don't stick to me"
"Adhesive," she said, "don't stick to me"

Inseminating motives of lukewarm persistence
Let the thieves in through the front door
Let them take what they've been missing

It's as if someone raised the price of dying
To maximum vend again
Turn slowly for maximum vend
Turn slowly for maximum vend
Turn slowly for maximum vend
Turn slowly for maximum vend

Don't stick to me
Count back from ten
