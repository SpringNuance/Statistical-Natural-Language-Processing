Now, does it hurt you when you breathe?
Stink around the wallet itch
A towel thrown between the ropes
Sweat inside your eyelids

It exercised the fire from the sky
(Snake charmer make them dance again)
It exercised the fire from the sky
(Make them itch in kerosene dance)

Prepare your sleep apparatus
Prepare your sleep apparatus
Prepare your sleep apparatus
Prepare, prepare

Autopsy, performed on probable cause
And while you sleep
They will come and get you tonight
(So I guess this is goodnight)

You skip with elbowed sobs
Your palms were soaking wet
Parched in the stupor
We'll both teach the tutor

You peel the scabs
Incognito with wounds
This anecdote fountain
It went dry too soon

Five hundred times
(I must not talk out of turn)
Five hundred times

You skip with elbowed sobs
Your palms were soaking wet
Parched in the stupor
We'll both teach the tutor

No vents opened but all settlements new
A second native for deserved growth
No vents opened but all settlements new
A second native for deserved growth

Permission to land, all systems go propeller snapped
Decapitated while you slept upon your pillow

Inertia kisses those around me
(We're not sure)
Inertia kisses those around me
(We're not sure)
Inertia kisses those around me
(We're not sure)

Autopsy, performed on probable cause
And while you sleep
They will come and get you tonight

You skip with elbowed sobs
Your palms were soaking wet
Parched in the stupor
We'll both teach the tutor

You skip with elbowed sobs
Your palms were soaking wet
Parched in the stupor
We'll both teach the tutor
