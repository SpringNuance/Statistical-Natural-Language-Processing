T-minus ten seconds and counting
Ten seconds and counting
T-minus ten seconds and counting
Ten seconds to go
T-minus ten seconds and counting

Metronome charisma
Keeping time in slingshot tempo

Utopia, the landfill crawls
Omens that back the truth
Erase the veins of this dateline
As it tells the story
Of this Roman fracture space time cliché

I can't believe the feeble recipe
Civilization tastes so good
Nero has conquered the stars
No one ever saw the spacesuit togas
A wreath around the head like Saturn's rings

Stole your recipe
The ghost ship cemetery
We won't lie

T-minus ten seconds and counting
Ten seconds to go
T-minus

Utopia, the landfill crawls
Omens that back the truth
Erase the veins of this dateline
As it tells the story
Of this Roman fracture space time cliché

I can't believe, et tu, Brute? Unfolding
Under the breath, under the fall Caligula time warp
Decadence in fleets come rain storming
Under threats of gluttony and lies

Stole your recipe
The ghost ship cemetery
We won't lie
