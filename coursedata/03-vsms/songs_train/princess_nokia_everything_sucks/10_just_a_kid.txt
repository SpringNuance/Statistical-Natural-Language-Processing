Got the beat by Powers and we just made a banger

Now damn, I'm just a kid
Thinking 'bout everything I ever done did
Things I wanna do and things I've done lived
Everything slow, but I really wanna live, now say
Damn, I'm just a kid
Thinking 'bout everything I wanna do and did
Thinking 'bout if I go far or go big
Thinking 'bout if I go dumb or go big

I'm a child just like no other
When I get scared I hide under covers
On a sad day, man, I really miss my mother
Only get one and you never get another
When I was a child, I was barely loved
Mommy passed away and my daddy was on drugs
Granny took me in with her 5 kids
And up until 8, that's where I always live
Granny got sick and then she passed away
And biggest heartbreak that I ever did take
Things were so good, man, things were so great
And then in one day, my whole life had changed
Suddenly, I'm out here adopted
No one from my family gave me the option
To live with my family or someone familiar
Gave me away to a person with hidden agendas
Passed to stranger who needed the money
She was a psycho, she never loved me
Damn, my whole life, everyone had to fuck me
Wow, I guess I'm just lucky

Now damn, I'm just a kid
Thinking 'bout everything I ever done did
Things I wanna do and things I've done lived
Everything slow, but I really wanna live, now say
Damn, I'm just a kid
Thinking 'bout everything I wanna do and did
Thinking 'bout if I go far or go big
Thinking 'bout if I go dumb or go big

I never mattered, nobody ever cared
Gave me to strangers who claimed me as theirs
I was abused and I was aware
She told me to lie and say that I had fell
Damn, I got marks on my face
Disassociate and my thoughts go erased
Numb in my soul, I feel so out of place
Long way from home, I need out of this place
I'm the sad kid and the bad kid
I'm a disappointment and I'm average
Never make her proud, all I do is damage
Called me a burden, but she took advantage

Now damn, I'm just a kid
Thinking 'bout everything I ever done did
Things I wanna do and things I've done lived
Everything slow, but I really wanna live, now say
Damn, I'm just a kid
Thinking 'bout everything I wanna do and did
Thinking 'bout if I go far or go big
Thinking 'bout if I go dumb or go big

She said she loved me, she didn't like me
I wasn't special and I wasn't likely
Wasn't that cute, no one would want me
Nobody cared, in that, I was forgotten
Left as an orphan, no other options
She hit me again and I want her to stop it
The place of my soul has grown microscopic
They take me on weekends and act like they care
I lived in fear, I was young, I was scared
The scars of my childhood have followed me here
The patterns repeat and they come back right here
The patterns repeat and they come back right here
