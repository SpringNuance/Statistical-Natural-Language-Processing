Skechers lookin' like Balenciaga
Thrift clothes lookin' like the Prada
Whole fit lit, it cost me nada
Bitches always talkin', I give them all nada
I'm so fly, I don't even try
I get so high, I can touch the sky
Dress for myself, I don't dress for hype
I dress for myself, you dress for the likes

Lookin' like a milli, but I only cost twenty
Smokin' big gas, and damn, it smell funny
Ain't a fuckin' thing that no one could tell me
I drop the fits and I drop the hits
Pull the alarm as soon as it's lit
Bitches be pressed, I make bitches sick
Bitches be mad, I blow them a kiss
Drip everywhere on account of the clothes
I'm going dumb, switch up on my flow
I be right up when I'm down ten toes
Always make a lot of money sellin' out my shows
Anime lit and I'm blessed with the drip
Baby biohazard, the slime go real quick
Money a knot and it look like a cyst
I smoke 'em big choppers, go get me a zip

Skechers lookin' like Balenciaga

Bitches always talkin', I give them all nada
I'm so fly, I don't even try
I get so high, I can touch the sky
Dress for myself, I don't dress for hype
I dress for myself, you dress for the likes

I take a sip, sip apple juice
I know I'm fly, I know I'm cute
Bitches clout chase and they act hella rude
My priorities straight, I don't know about you
Is that VETEMENTS? Yves Saint-Laurent?
Is it Off-White or COMME des GARÇONS?
My imagination, I do what I want
If I look broke 'cause I don't give a fuck
Is that Chanel or basic as hell?
Is that retail or is that resale?
I look so fly, you can't even tell
They all spendin' money, I just get it free, yeah
