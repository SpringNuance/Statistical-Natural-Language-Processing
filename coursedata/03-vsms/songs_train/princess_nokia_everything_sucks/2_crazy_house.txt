Mm, dah-dah-dah, mm, dah
Mm, dah-dah-dah, mm, dah
Mm, dah-dah-dah, mm, dah, ah

Pretty little psycho, I get down with the payroll
I'm a fallen angel and I hit you with my halo
Smiling in your face 'cause I'm mentally unstable
Yes, I got that juice, got that blueberry Faygo
Call me 7:30 with that dirty, I'm so crazy
Ain't no motherfucker that could ever say they made me
What they say, bro? I don't care what they say, bro
Fallen angel, everything is painful

I came here to party, to bring destruction and violence
My body started a riot and now the children can't fight it
No, I will never be silent, I'm equal raver and tyrant
I fuck with clowns and them pirates, that freaky shit got me smiling

Let me out of the crazy house
Let me out of the crazy house, let me out
Let me out of the crazy house
Let me out of the crazy house, let me out
Let me out of the crazy house
Let me out of the crazy house, let me out
Mm, dah-dah-dah, mm, dah
Mm, dah-dah-dah, mm
Let me out of the crazy house
Let me out of the crazy house, let me out
Let me out of the crazy house
Let me out of the crazy house, let me out
Let me out of the crazy house
Let me out of the crazy house, let me out
Mm, dah-dah-dah, mm, dah
Mm, dah-dah-dah, mm

Rotten fruits and severed heads
I'm the monster under your bed
I'm the goblin from the dead
I'm the witch up in the lead
Pussy popping in the dungeon
Throw your man up in this cauldron
Let me sacrifice you, baby
Got his dick up in a coffin
I'm the young Lorena Bobbitt
If I want it, I'ma cop it
If I hate it, I'ma chop it
I'm a psychotic hottie
Gothic bitch, just like a thottie
Santa's list, I'm always naughty
Ripping hearts just like a hobby
I'm sadistic and I'm sloppy

I came here to party to bring destruction and violence
My body started a riot and now the children can't fight it
No, I will never be silent, I'm equal raver and tyrant
I fuck with clowns and them pirates, that freaky shit got me smiling

Let me out of the crazy house
Let me out of the crazy house, let me out
Let me out of the crazy house
Let me out of the crazy house, let me out
Let me out of the crazy house
Let me out of the crazy house, let me out
Mm, dah-dah-dah, mm, dah
Mm, dah-dah-dah, mm
Let me out of the crazy house
Let me out of the crazy house, let me out
Let me out of the crazy house
Let me out of the crazy house, let me out
Let me out of the crazy house
Let me out of the crazy house, let me out
Mm, dah-dah-dah, mm, dah
Mm, dah-dah-dah, mm
