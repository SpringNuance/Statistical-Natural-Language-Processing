Yeah, yeah, yeah, bitch, I'm gross (Bitch, I'm gross)
Yeah, I'm grosser then you hoes and it shows
I got stains on my teeth and my clothes (On my clothes)
I been sleep on the motherfucking floor
I been locked in the studio more
I been kicking my foot in the door
I been riding my wave to the core (Get it)
If you think you hate me, you gon' hate me more (What? What?)

All in my face like you know me
Bitches love beef like it's Kobe
New York, I am a OG
Everything 'bout me is holy
I am the last of the old me
I hear the rumors about me
I hear the people that doubt me
I think it's kind of arousing
I love the chatter that happens around me
Stick out my tongue like the people of Maori
Talking online, well, you are a coward
People see me and they already sour
I just got richer in less then an hour
No 50 Cent, but I got the power
Think that you smoking, but I got the louder
All of the boys want parts of my flowers
Rappers hit me up, I friend zone them all
I'm not the woman for your beck and call
I am a rapper, I'm not a groupie
I do campaigns, world tours, and the movies
Got every right in this world to be choosey
It's a new decade and I am blooming

Yeah, yeah, yeah, bitch, I'm gross (Bitch, I'm gross)
Yeah, I'm grosser then you hoes and it shows
I got stains on my teeth and my clothes (On my clothes)
I been sleep on the motherfucking floor
I been locked in the studio more
I been kicking my foot in the door
I been riding my wave to the core (Get it)
If you think you hate me, you gon' hate me more (What? What?)

This pussy hocus pocus
He want it but I'm focused
Plague with the locust
Parting waters like I'm Moses (Who?)
They say I am chosen
Baby, I'm a prophet
Got a lot of enemies
I keep garlic in my pocket
And if I'm being honest
I know you throwing evil
Put my name in the cauldron
But, I still can't see you
No, I do not fear you (On God)
I do not fear nothing (Oh, no)
God is my leader
I know the wrath is coming
Lemme call the corners (Go 'head)
Conquer all disorders
You be screaming bloody murder
While I drag you on the corner (Mmhm)
I'm fighting with my words
I think they call it spelling
I done called the Babalawo
The priestress and the reverend (That me, on me, on me)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, bitch, I'm gross (Bitch, I'm gross)
Yeah, I'm grosser then you hoes and it shows
I got stains on my teeth and my clothes (On my clothes)
I been sleep on the motherfucking floor
I been locked in the studio more
I been kicking my foot in the door
I been riding my wave to the core (Get it)
If you think you hate me, you gon' hate me more (What? What?)
