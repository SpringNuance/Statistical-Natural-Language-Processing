Got the beat by Powers and we just made a banger

I like him, like him too
He my man, he my boo
He my type, he so cute
I want him, and I want him too
I like him, like him too
He my man, he my boo
He my type, he so cute
I want him, and I want him too

Hop in the whip, hop in the truck
I do whatever the fuck that I want
I'm not a ho, I'm not a slut
I like to fuck and I sure like to suck
I am that bold, freezy like ice
I'm not a wife, so talk to me nice
You ain't my type, I don't like you
You a broke boy, look at your shoes
I am the player and I am the pimp
All of them boys, make 'em the trick
All of them boys, they on my shit
But all of them boys, they make me sick

I do not see you taming me
'Less them, they're entertaining me
They just tryna p-play with me
Play with me, you gon' pay the fee

I like him, like him too
He my man, he my boo
He my type, he so cute
I want him, and I want him too
I like him, like him too
He my man, he my boo
He my type, he so cute
I want him, and I want him too

Dibble in this, and dibble in that
Get on his head like I am a brat
Play with his balls when he up to bat
Make daddy real proud like I'm Kyla Pratt
I'm taking a shower, he makin' the bed
When I leave the city, I leave him on read
Go get the next, like I get the bread
He coming with questions, I call him the feds
He let me plead the fifth
'Cause he know this box a gift
Eating breakfast, not at Tiff'
When I curve him he get stiff
I go beast mode
Ball like free throw
Game like cheat code
Pounds like kilo

I like him, like him too
He my man, he my boo
He my type, he so cute
I want him, and I want him too
I like him, like him too
He my man, he my boo
He my type, he so cute
I want him, and I want him too

I do not see you taming me
'Less them, they're entertaining me
They just tryna p-play with me
Play with me, you gon' pay the fee
