Front row show
Campaign, let's go
Politics, no-no
Hip-hop, high school
Rap game, shit show
People don't give me my props
Fuck, I don't like them big opps

It's a success when I big drop
Rush to the store when they big cop
I don't believe in flop
Underground, mainstream
I brought punk to hip-hop
I brought weird to the block
No major deals, but I finesse Coachella
Bitches with clout love to think that they better
Accomplished shit that you bitches could never
Who cares if you bad 'cause I'm smart and I'm clever
Act nice just to get by
Deep down, I hate you guys
You guys are not my type
Don't fuck with your dumb hype
19, savage
Last year, that was practice
New new, action
Fuck the game, I got passion
Glowing up, satisfaction
New year, reaction
Been down, it was tragic
Now I go hard like it's madness
I'm a rockstar, I like fashion

Glove off, mask off
Real soft, me
Glove off, mask off
Real soft, me
Glove off, mask off
Real soft, me, me, me, me

You know Princess be the mood board
You know Princess be the mood for
Industry bitches who wanna be different
You still selling pop, who the fuck is you kidding?
But they copy and paste, but they can't erase
My right or my place, I show them my face
I give them the eye, people said I was a witch
Now I'm taking what's mine
I'm that little witch girl with your name in the pot
People wanna do me evil, now you see what I got
Now I'm flying on my broom, going straight to the top
