Fee fi foe, catch a boy by his toe
And if I see his bitch, I'ma never let her know
'Cause I'm a freaky bitch and I keep it on the low
Hood boys love me, from the Brims to the Locs

I'm in my own lane
This shit the whole same
Something's just have to change
I'ma shake up this whole damn thang
I read on my contract
So nobody trap me
If I gotta be up on my own
Well fuck it baby, I'ma just have to be
This shit empowers me
To make all my power moves
I'm focused on bettering me
You just focus on bettering you
I never signed a deal
I gotta keep it real
I really made a mill'
Off of these rapping skills
Off of my talent
I bring the action
I love this rap shit
Straight with a passion
Jackie Joyner-Kersee, damn, I run the limit
I got a hunnid bands and you know I'm gonna spend it
I took a little break, you ain't see me in a minute
Well bitch, I'm back and I'm all way in it
These bitches in my business they gossiping 'bout my riches
They nosy endless, endless, why do they not get the message?
My legacy relentless, I'm pushing it to the limit
I'm playing with no scrimmage, they cheering up on my image
The buzzer, I gotta hit it, I been talking to the spirits
Traveling through the dimensions, I can see right through your gimmick

God, grant me the serenity
To accept the things that I cannot change
The courage to change the things I can
And the wisdom to know the difference
Living one day at a time
Enjoying one moment at a time
Accepting hardships as a pathway to peace
Taking, as Jesus did
This sinful world as it is
Not as I would have it
Trusting that You will make all things right
If I surrender to Your will
So that I may be reasonably happy in this life
And supremely happy with You forever in the next
Amen
