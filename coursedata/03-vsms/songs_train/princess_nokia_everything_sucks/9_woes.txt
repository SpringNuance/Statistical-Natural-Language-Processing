Ayy, ayy, ayy

I'm chillin' with the skaters, I'm chillin' with the punks
I'm chillin' in the park with the kids having fun
I love my youts, I love my fun
Love hanging out with my day ones
I may be in a cloud, I may be on some shrooms
I'm the highest one, highest one in the room
I love my woes, I love my dudes
This is for the highs, for the lows, for the blues

I say let's go
I'ma give you what you asking for
I love my woes
I love their dope
I say let's go
I'ma give you what you asking for
I love my woes
I love their dope

I'm 'bout to roll a blunt, I'm bout to drink a brew
I'm chillin' in New York with the Tompkins crew
I'm chillin' in the 40s, Echo too
I'm chillin' in Watts with a whole lotta crews
I'm living for the moment, it's only one life
You only get one and you don't get twice
I'm chillin' with my people, I'm dancing in the crowd
I got so high, I ain't never coming down

I say let's go
I'ma give you what you asking for
I love my woes
I love their dope
I say let's go
I'ma give you what you asking for
I love my woes
I love their dope

Oh, oh
Woah, woah
