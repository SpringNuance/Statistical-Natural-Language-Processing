(One, two, three, go!)

Welcome to the circus, I'm causing a disturbance
I'm twisted in the head, I'm a little bit annoying
I'm gross, I'm sick, I'm too legit to quit
Got bitches showing tits and boys moshing in the pit
It's a rocket in my pocket and I'm not gonna stop it
And if I see a target guaranteed that I'ma knock it, bitch
Bitch, bitch
Bitch, bitch (Yeah, yeah)
My bitches came to rage, we do this every day
We're not in the same pace, so just stay up in your lane, bitch

Harley Quinn
Bitch, I've been
Goin' in

Who that? Who that? Who that?
The bitch is back
Who that? Who that? Who that?
I will attack
Who that? Who that? Who that?
The bitch is back
Who that? Who that? Who that?
I will attack

I'm going crazy and dumb, I'm disrespectful as fuck
I heard they mad and they angry, their daddy ain't showed 'em love
I don't give no fucks, matter fact, not two
I'm disrespectful, offensive, and I've got nothing to prove
Fuck you, and fuck you
And fuck you, fuck you, we fuck you
Fuck you, fuck you
Fuck you, fuck you, we fuck you

Fuck your mama and daddy
Fuck your siblings too
Fuck your auntie and uncle
We fuck your cousins and crew
Fuck your ugly ass baby
Fuck these bitches that's hatin'
Fuck these stupid ass trolls
They don't wanna see me famous

Who that? Who that? Who that?
The bitch is back
Who that? Who that? Who that?
I will attack
Who that? Who that? Who that?
The bitch is back
Who that? Who that? Who that?
I will attack
