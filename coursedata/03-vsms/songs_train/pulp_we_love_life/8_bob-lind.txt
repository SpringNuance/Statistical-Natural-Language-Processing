When you think you're treading water, but you're just learning how to drown
And a song comes on the radio telling you that "The Only Way is Down"
You're out of luck, you're out of time, get out of here
Your lover just traded you in for the very same model but a much more recent year

It will not stop, it will get worse from day to day 'til you admit that you're a fuck-up; like the rest of us
Oh, that's the time you fall apart
That's the time the teardrops start & that's the time you fall in love again
Yeah, that's the time you fall in love again

The recreational pursuits that made you shine have worn you thin
And it's oh so fine getting out of your mind as long as you can find your way back in
You want someone to screw your brains out
I'd say they're running out of time & they'd only go & cut themselves on the daggers of your mind

This is your future
This is the sentence you must serve 'til you admit that you're a fuck-up like the rest of us
Oh, that's the time you fall apart
That's the time the teardrops start & that's the time you fall in love again
When you've had enough, when you've had too much
When you got knocked down & you never got up
That's the time you fall in love again

Oh, when you walked into the room I could not breathe, I could not speak
Please could I hide myself inside you?
As far inside as it's possible to be
Can you assist me? I could not make it on my own
Can I give you all the love I have?
It's not much but I'll try & raise a loan

I have no pride left, no, no there is nothing I'm trying to prove
No, I am a fuck-up; just the same as you
Oh, I guess this is where I fall apart
And I guess this is where the teardrops start but I don't care 'cos I just fell in love again
And I'd had enough - well, far too much
I just fell down, could you please help me up?
"Cos if you help me maybe I could fall in love again. Na na na
