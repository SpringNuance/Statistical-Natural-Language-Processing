We came across the North Sea with our carriers on our knees
Wound up in some holding camp somewhere outside Leeds
Because we do not care to fight, my friends - we are the weeds
Because we got no homes they call us smelly refugees
Ah. We are weeds, vegetation, dense undergrowth
Thru' cracks in the pavement: there weeds will grow - the places you don't go
This cut-price dairy produce that turns our bones to dust
You want some entertainment?
Go on, shove it up me - if you must
Make believe you're so turned on by planting trees & shrubs
But you come round to visit us when you fancy booze 'n' drugs
Ah. We are weeds, vegetation, etc
If you think it's a crime
We'd like to get you out of your mind
It's just a matter of time, yeah
We'd like to get you out of your mind
Gonna cut you down in your prime, yeah
We'd like to get you out of your mind
For a little time: for all time
Weed
