It's six o'clock, the birds are singing
I'm wide awake whilst you're still fast asleep
I went outside, into your garden
The sun was bright & the air was cool
And as I stood there listening
Well the birds in your garden they all started singing this song
"Take her now. Don't be scared, it's alright
Oh, come on, touch her inside
It's a crime against nature - she's been waiting all night
Come on, hold her, & kiss her & tell her you care
If you wait 'til tomorrow she'll no longer be there
Come on & give it to her
You know it's now or never."
Yeah, the birds in your garden have all started singing this song

My father never told me about the birds & the bees
And I guess I never realised that I would ever meet birds as beautiful as these
I came inside, climbed to your bedroom
I kissed your eyes awake & then I did what I knew was only natural
And then the birds in your garden, they all started singing this song
"Take her now. Don't be scared, it's alright
Oh, come on, touch her inside
It's a crime against nature - she's been waiting all night
Come on, hold her, & kiss her & tell her you care
If you wait 'til tomorrow she'll no longer be there
Come on & give it to her. You know it's now or never."
Yeah, the birds in your garden have all started singing this song
Yeah, the birds in your garden, they taught me the words to this song
