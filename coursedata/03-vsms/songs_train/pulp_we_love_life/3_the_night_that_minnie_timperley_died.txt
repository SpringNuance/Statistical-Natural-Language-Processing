"There's a light that shines on everything and everyone
And it shines so bright, brighter even than the sun"
That's what Minnie thinks as she walks to meet her brother
Who is nearly two years older on a Saturday night
He's DJing at some do on the edge of town
On the night that Minnie Timperley died

It's such a beautiful world
You're such a beautiful girl
So much that you want to try
The world wants to sleep with you tonight
But Minnie, Minnie if I could
I would give you the rest of my life

How can a girl have sex with these pathetic teenage wrecks?
Oh, football scarves, the girls drink halves and her brother's crying 'cos he has lost his decks
Outside the air was cool, an older guy sitting in his car
Asked if Minnie needed a ride
He thought he was still dangerous, paunchy, but dangerous
On the night that Minnie Timperley died

It's such a beautiful world
You're such a beautiful girl
And he only did what he did
'Cos you looked like one of his kids
But Minnie, Minnie if I could
I would give you the rest of my life

Oh, Minnie I can feel the pain
Oh, Minnie I can feel the pain
Oh, Minnie I can feel the pain
The pain, the pain, the pain, pain, pain, yeah
