Here comes your bedtime story: Mum & Dad have sentenced you to life
Don't think twice; it's the only reason I'm alive
I feel alright as long as I don't forget to breathe
Breathe in, breathe in, breathe out
Look at all these buildings & houses
I love my life. I love my life
Hey now, slow down a minute
Take my arms & fill them full of life
Don't think twice
Does it ease the pain of being alive?
Or is it why - why you keep nodding out on me?
Breathe in, breathe in, breathe out
Another day, another major disaster
I love my life. I love my life
You got a problem
I lost my keys when I stayed at your place
On the floor of your living room, you made the scene but it'll never get shown on TV
So tonight prepare to kiss goodbye to my lovelife
So get this right- I love my life; it's the only reason I'm alive
It's mine, all mine - as long as I don't forget to breathe
Breathe in, breathe in, breathe out
Corny I know, but you had better believe it
I love my life. I love my life. I love my life. God, how I love my life
That's right: you've got to fight to the death for the right to live your life
Alright: I'm gonna fight to the death 'til they give me back my life
That's right: you're in the land of the living but there's so few signs of life
Alright
Breathe in. Breathe out. Breathe out
