I used to hate the sun
Because it shone on everythin' I'd done
Made me feel that all that I had done
Was overfill the ashtray of my life
All my achievements in days of yore
Range from pathetic
To piss-poor
But all that's gonna change

Because here comes sunrise
Yeah, here's your sunrise

I used to hide from the sun
Tried to live my whole life underground, umm
Why'd you have to rise and ruin all my fun?
Just turn over, close the curtains on the day

Because here comes sunrise
Yeah, here's your sunrise

When you've been awake all night long
And you feel like crashin' out at dawn
But you've been awake all night
So why should you crash out at dawn?
