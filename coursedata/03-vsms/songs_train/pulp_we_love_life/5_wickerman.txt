Just behind the station, before you reach the traffic island, a river runs through' a concrete channel
I took you there once; I think it was after the Leadmill
The water was dirty
And it smelt of industrialisation
Little mesters coughing their lungs up
And globules the colour of tomato ketchup
But it flows. Yeah, it flows
Underneath the city through' dirty brickwork conduits
Connecting white witches on the Moor with pre-raphaelites down in Broomhall
Beneath the old Trebor factory that burnt down in the early seventies
Leaving an antiquated sweet-shop smell
And caverns of nougat and caramel
Nougat
Yeah, nougat and caramel
And the river flows on
Yeah, the river flows on beneath pudgy fifteen-year olds addicted to coffee whitener

I went there again for old time's sake
Hoping to find the child's toy horse ride that played such a ridiculously tragic tune
It was still there - but none of the kids seemed interested in riding on it
And the cafe was still there too
The same press-in plastic letters on the price list and scuffed formica-top tables
I sat as close as possible to the seat where I'd met you that autumn afternoon
And then, after what seemed like hours of thinking about it
I finally took your face in my hands and I kissed you for the first time
And a feeling like electricity flowed through' my whole body
And all the time, in the background, the sound of that ridiculously heartbreaking child's ride outside

At the other end of town the river flows underneath an old railway viaduct
I went there with you once - except you were somebody else -
And we gazed down at the sludgy brown surface of the water together
Then a passer-by told us that it used to be a local custom to jump off the viaduct into the river
When coming home from the pub on a Saturday night
But that this custom had died out when someone jumped and landed too near to the riverbank and had sunk in the mud there and drowned before anyone could reach them
I don't know if he'd just made the whole story up, but there's no way you'd get me to jump off that bridge
No chance. Never in a million years

Yeah, a river flows underneath this city
I'd like to go there with you now my pretty "amp; follow it on for miles "amp; miles, below other people's ordinary lives
Occasionally catching a glimpse of the moon, through' man-hole covers along the route
Yeah, it's dark sometimes but if you hold my hand, I think I know the way
Oh, this is as far as we got last time
But if we go just another mile we will surface surrounded by grass "amp; trees "amp; the fly-over that takes the cars to cities
Buds that explode at the slightest touch, nettles that sting - but not too much
I've never been past this point, what lies ahead I really could not say
I used to live just by the river, in a dis-used factory just off the Wicker
The river flowed by day after day
"One day" I thought, "One day I will follow it" but that day never came
I moved away "amp; lost track but tonight I am thinking about making my way back
I may find you there "amp; float on wherever the river may take me
Wherever the river may take me
Wherever the river may take us
Wherever it wants us to go
Wherever it wants us to go
