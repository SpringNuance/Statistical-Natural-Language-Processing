The proposition handcuffed to the park bench
Hypodermic people poking fun at the living
Please lift the weight out of this it takes the weight out of living
Are we just infants that are ripe for the training?
The opposition can't feel the tentacle reach
Suction cup the numb arms of the elderly
Please lift the weight out of this it takes the weight out of living
Let these walkers trip on endless proof

Pattern against user - dilated
Bastard waiting for nothing

Circus carny guarding
The gates of heaven
Like stuck in limbo abduction
Wormed our way through
Distant earth
Wormed our way through
Distant earth

This intuition limps with the cane of suspicion
Folding space in the crease of this page
It takes the weight out of this it takes the weight out of
Trickling the ticking of this grandfather clock
The opposition can't feel the tentacle reach
Suction cup the numb arms of the elderly

Like stuck in limbo abduction
Wormed our way through
Distant earth
Wormed our way through
Distant earth

And if this clock keeps ticking away
Will time be hesitated
Of all the minutes that were taken away
Will your watch be waiting
Sand falls through
Time portals
These landfills
We mortals
And if this clock keeps beating down
Let the branded time keep playing
Of all the minutes that were taken away
Will your watch be waiting

Distant earth, hey!
