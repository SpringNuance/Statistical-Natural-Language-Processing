Lark throated spit through beaks tonight
These gagging chirps were written in disguise
What's that sound?
Caskets floating

Hey you did you ever intend to sleep inside my tomb
And would you ever pretend to kick from inside of this womb
Hey you did you ever attempt the excavation of these fossils
And in case you haven't noticed, we're already dead

This gravity is a quadriplegic horse and carriage
This gravity is a quadriplegic horse and carriage
This gravity is a quadriplegic horse and carriage

Pendulum swing through tantrum slits
This scalpel's graze untamed won't feel romantic
What's that sound?
Caskets floating
In laymen's terms sewn through matrimony

Hey you, did you ever intend to
Hey you, did you ever intend to
Hey you, did you ever intend to
Hey you...

This gravity is a quadriplegic horse and carriage
This gravity is a quadriplegic horse and carriage

What's that sound coming? Who can it be?
What's that sound I hear coming?

This gravity is a quadriplegic horse and carriage
