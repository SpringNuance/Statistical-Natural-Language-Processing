Pinch history feel the pinch blistering
Pinch me in dreams cause I'm still not listening
X marks the spot on your calendar days
A beard half eaten smiled crawling with legs
Temper temper temperature
Temper temper temperature

In infrared is how we saw
The night that lit up scarecrow plots
The nerve that pinches
Crippled hobbled frolicked flat on its own face
In infrared is how we saw
The night that lit up scarecrow plots
The nerve that pinches
Crippled hobbled frolicked flat on its own face

Jigsaw pattern dominoes left a trail
The whites of their eyes polaroids of the tale
For our amusement we bring stares to the defendants
Mechanical panaceas absolved by history
Phonetic paralysis inflicted through morality
The seed that it nurtured was a wilted bouquet
Temper temper temperature
Temper temper temperature

Squirming through cuts in a throat, cut it... cut it...
Squirming through cuts in a throat, yeah cut it... yeah cut it...
