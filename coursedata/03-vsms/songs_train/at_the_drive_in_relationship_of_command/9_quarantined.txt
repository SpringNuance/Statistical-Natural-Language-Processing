Autonomous machete for hands
Warden and judge hide behind masks
Wet raindrop lull small rationing
Exhumed the rhetoric
Of break the weak in single file

Sanction this outbreak, a virus conspires
Push becomes shove, days become months
I seem to have forgotten the warmth of the sun

Feeding frenzy, it's contagious
(Have trigger, will travel)(have trigger, will travel)
Feeding frenzy, it's contagious
(have trigger, will travel)(have trigger, will travel)
Single spark starts spectral fires
(have trigger, will travel)(have trigger, will travel)
Feeding frenzy, it's contagious

Shackled the grapple and the sentinels found binoculars watch cardboard towns
Strung up in webs the net was flung
Over the auditorium
Slave trade the weak, no call to arms

Sanction this outbreak, a virus conspires
Push becomes shove, days become months
I seem to have forgotten the warmth of the sun

Feeding frenzy, it's contagious
(have trigger, will travel(have trigger, will travel)
A single spark can start a spectral fire
(have trigger, will travel)(have trigger, will travel)
Feeding frenzy, it's contagious
(have trigger, will travel)(have trigger, will travel)
A single spark can start a spectral fire
(have trigger, will travel)(have trigger, will travel)

A single spark can start a spectral fire, have trigger will travel
A single spark can start a spectral fire, have trigger will travel
A single spark can start a spectral fire, have trigger will travel
A single spark can start a spectral fire, have trigger will travel
A single spark can start a spectral fire...
