I must have read a thousand faces
I must have robbed them of their cause
Sickened thirst, sickened thirst keeps it together
Soft white glow in the cranium, a bulls eye made sedated

Beware!
Beware!
Beware!

I must have read a thousand faces
And all these voices won't give up
Sickened thirst, sickened thirst glues it together
Catatonic leisure at 1000 miles per hour

Beware!
Beware!
Beware!

So who's in charge in here
Barking out loud so clear
Because I'd really like to meet him
So who's in charge in here
In the rear-view of this mirror
Because I'd really like to meet him
So who's in charge in here
Barking out loud so clear
Because I'd really like to meet him
Uproar east, strike west

Have you ever tasted skin?
Sink your, sink your teeth in it
Have you ever tasted skin?
Sink your teeth into...
Have you ever...?

Beware!
Beware!
Beware!
Aaah, beware!
Beware!
Beware!
