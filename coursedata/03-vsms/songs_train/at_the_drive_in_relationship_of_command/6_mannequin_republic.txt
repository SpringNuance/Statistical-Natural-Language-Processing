They call it a wasteland, auslander plates
You know its armor was human
Drove stakes into the main camps
Eye sockets sank to the back of his head again

This frequency was jet lagged
Yes, the wrinkles mate
With the owner's manual
With the owner's manual

Frequent flyers in denial
And all the while, emergency is evident
Revenants were the statues
Radar learning of huddled masses

Sutured all the patience of this nursing home
Omitted from the pages of this burial ground
Sutured all the patience of this nursing home
Omitted from the pages of this burial ground

Labor concentrated in this sheepless chapel
Labor concentrated in this sheepless chapel

They call it a wasteland, they call it a wasteland, baby
They call it a wasteland, they call it a wasteland, baby
They call it a, they call it a, they call it a, they call it a

Sutured all the patience of this nursing home
Omitted from the pages of this burial ground
