Hello?

Hello mother leopard, I have your cub
You must protect her, but that will be expensive
10,000 kola nuts, wrapped in brown paper
Midnight, behind the box
I'll be the hyena, you'll see

This could last us all a lifetime
Limbs intact, untouched
On the screen of a video tape
Confined to bedposts we wait as lepers
Upheld at knife's reach we covet all the status quo
This syringe will take a lifespan
It's filled with bait and tackle
Try and catch us if you can

Sacrifice on railroad tracks
Freight freight train coming
Freight freight train coming
Unconscious tied and gagged
Freight freight train coming
Freight freight train coming
Sacrifice on railroad tracks
Freight freight train coming
Freight freight train coming

Meet us at the corner of Fifth and Pontiac
But make sure that no one else is with you
If you wish to see them alive again
Then humor me with this request
Humor me with this request
In basements we will hide
Amnesia in our alibis

Sacrifice on railroad tracks
Freight freight train coming
Freight freight train coming
Unconscious tied and gagged
Freight freight train coming
Freight freight train coming
Sacrifice on railroad tracks
Freight freight train coming
Freight freight train coming

They kept a close eye on your get well incentive
They kept a close eye on your get well incentive

Sacrifice on railroad tracks

Freight freight train coming
Unconscious tied and gagged
Freight freight train coming
Freight freight train coming
Sacrifice on railroad tracks
Freight freight train coming
Freight freight train coming

Sacrifice on railroad tracks
Freight freight train coming
Freight freight train coming
Unconscious tied and gagged
Freight freight train coming
Freight freight train coming
Sacrifice on railroad tracks
