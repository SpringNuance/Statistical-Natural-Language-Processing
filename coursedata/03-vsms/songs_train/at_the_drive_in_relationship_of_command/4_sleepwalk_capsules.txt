Taser taser kindergarten nap nap time
Pacifier pacifies, yeah it pacifies
Highchair crumbles unannounced
Like a draft from outside
Pacifier pacifies, yeah it pacifies
Beacon shined a light from the faulty tower
Pacifier pacifies, yeah it pacifies
Colossal in tons, unknowing it wants
Pacifier pacifies, yeah it pacifies

Atop this podium
Built of fixation
(They like to choke)
All utensils fixed on you

Cranes perched in scowls, in the windows they would peek
Pacifier pacifies, yeah it pacifies
Snuck inside the sound of sleep
Pacifier pacifies, yeah it pacifies
Don't sweat the hemorrhaging glance
Don't sweat the hemorrhaging glance
Pacifier pacifies, yeah it pacifies
Feast upon your illness and let the puppet strings sag
Pacifier pacifies, yeah it pacifies

Atop this podium
Built of fixation
(They like to choke)
All utensils fixed on you

(They like it)
Atop this podium
Split in confession

Lazarus threw the party

Cloak a dagger plot her sovereign majesty
Pacifier pacifies, yeah it pacifies
Bullet ridden with vermin be it the peasant stark frenzy
Pacifier pacifies, yeah it pacifies
Held onto its tusks, naked and disrobed
Pacifier pacifies, yeah it pacifies
And the emperor still wears no clothes
Pacifier pacifies, yeah it pacifies

Atop this podium
Built of fixation
(They like to choke)
All utensils fixed on you
