Pigeon-holed decision
Making all my mind's made up
I only colored outside the lines
Because I forgot

Stenciled teen initials
That were carved
On the roof of my mouth
Only to mark the words of so-and-so
Fuck so-and-so
So-and-so

I've been dancing in the bathroom stalls
Excreting words meant for this song
Well, I'm kicking in windows
It makes music to me

Please get some medication
Simple, it's simple to get
We must die with dignity

Please get some medication
Simple, it's simple to get
We must die

Please get some medication
Simple, it's simple to get

Pallbearer, we are and all that we never get
And all my little pushes fall on your
Deaf!
Ears!

Kicking in these windows
Kicking in these windows
On the roof of my mouth
I'm gonna mark the words
On the roof of my mouth
I'm gonna mark

Kicking in these windows
In these windows
It's on the roof of my mouth
I'm gonna mark the words
It's on the roof of my mouth

Kicking in these windows
Kicking in these windows
On the roof of my mouth
I'm gonna mark the words
On the roof of my mouth

Tickling with contusions
Paper bag masks hiding infantile music
No pictures
Just words
Are you afraid of our books?
Illiterate cells
For the valley of mules

Well, I've been dancing in the bathroom stalls
Excreting words just for this song
Well, I'm kicking in windows
And you know what? It just does make music to me

Please get some medication
Simple, it's simple today
We must die with dignity

Please get some medication
Simple, it's simple to get
We must die with dignity

Please get some medication
Simple, it's simple today
We're gonna die

Pallbearer, we are and all that we never get
And all my little pushes fall on your
Deaf!
Ears!

Kicking in these windows
It's on the roof of my mouth
I'm gonna mark the words
It's on the roof of my mouth

Kicking in these windows
Kicking in these windows
On the roof of my mouth
I'm gonna mark the words
On the roof of my mouth
I'm gonna mark the...
Kicking in these windows
