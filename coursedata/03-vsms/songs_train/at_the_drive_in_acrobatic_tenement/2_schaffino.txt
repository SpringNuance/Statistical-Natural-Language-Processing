This time I'm gonna take the collection baby
And with the money in my hand
I'm gonna purchase all the details
Scrub you clean with my soap opera chirping

Walking on tiptoed pickpocket fever
Racing up the scales of your thermometer
Turnbuckle tourniquet clotting the moonshine
Clotheslined seizures singing happy valentines

I'm singing happy, happy, happy valentines, yeah

I found feathers in your hit and run nest, yeah
Omerttas not a prayer on your rosary beads
I found feathers in your hit and run nest, yeah

And when you say...

And when she knocked me over
I looked inside the hearse
Sprouting chauvinistic swine
And written were the words
Poking butter with this knife
Allergic to this concubine
Racing by in a '56 Chevy
And we couldn't even pretend
To be alive...
To be alive...
To be alive...
To be alive...
To be alive...
To be alive

I found feathers in your hit and run nest, yeah
Scrub you clean with my soap opera chirping
I found feathers in your
Hit and run
Nest
