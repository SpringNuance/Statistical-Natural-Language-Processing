I'm an incision
The kind that glistens
And not to mention we appeal when we've healed
I'm an incision
Just an incision
I've got Polaroid value in a celluloid way

With twelve hard years
Of currency
And they trade it all
For the current scene

I'm an incision
The kind that glistens
Polaroid value, celluloid way
This air condition
Is on intermission
We're burning on the border like they said we would

I'm an incision
Just an incision
The kind that glistens
And we appeal when we've healed
Burning in on the borders like they said that we would

With twelve hard years
Of currency
And they trade it all
For the current scene

They're partial to the way you speak
Blue tagged and blue tagged, blue tagged and incomplete
We're burning on the borders like they said that we would
It's been twelve hard years, yeah

They're partial to the way you speak
We're burning on the borders like they said we would
This intermission is on intermission
The kind that you get when you're burning on the border

With twelve hard years
Of currency
And they trade it all
For the current scene
The current scene
