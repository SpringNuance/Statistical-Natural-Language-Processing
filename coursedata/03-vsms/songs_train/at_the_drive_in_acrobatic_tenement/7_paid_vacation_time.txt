So we saw
The opportunities
The stitch and thread
With no down payments
Our neighbors see it through their own eyes
The others hear the story through the grapevine
Well, dot your i's
Cross your t's
This forfeiture's the burden of another, another

And all those friends you thought you had
Are laughing at and not with you
And all those friends you thought you knew
You'd trade it all for a tank full of fuel
Of fuel, yeah

I'm gonna trade it all...

With a sheepskin costume

Dot your i's
Cross your t's
The burden of another

Cross your i's
Dot your t's
This forfeiture's the burden of another, another

Dot your t's
