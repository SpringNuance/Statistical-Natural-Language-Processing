You keep telling me
This voltage hurts just a little
In the thickness of the van
You drop anchor if and when
Concealing all the thoughts
We hid and laughed forever
In the thickness of the van
You drop anchor if and when

Repelling essence swelling, something to blame
Bleeding profusely, outside looking tame
The nerve of your hometown...
I'm drinking slovenly

Leave me alone
Leave me alone
I am not your brother
I see five holes
In your flag

Repelling essence swelling, something to blame
And from these hands sweeps the grenade
I'm swimming down

Leave me alone
Leave me alone
(I am not your brother.)
Well, I'm not your brother
I see five holes
In your flag

Collect calling
The fuse is crawling
To the next hometown
Collect calling
The fuse is crawling
Can you feel the bite of my nails?
(Can you feel it? Can you feel it? Can you feel it?)
Can you feel the bite of my nails?

Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Well, I'm not your brother
I see five holes
In your flag

Leave me alone
Leave me alone
I am not your brother
I see five holes
In your flag. Yeah

Sink!
Swim!
Drown!
Together!
