Substation
Submerging
Suburban disturbance
Incoherent gourding

Coating of arms
They came a knocking paranoia in the walls
Where we heard family dying while the band played on
I said the band played on
Told sky to leave to the east
Bay clone
(Weren't you taking me to my home
Are you gonna take me to my home)
Weren't you taking me home

Secret service
We deserve this
We lost the friends
To the pavement
Yeah, to the pavement

Substation
Subconscious
Well, let's do our William Tell routine
(Let's do it)
Let's do our William Tell routine

We're chewing on the goodyear
(Yeah)
With handcuffs on the wristwatch
(Wristwatch)
We're chewing on the goodyear
(Chewing)
Let's do our William Tell routine

(Yeah!)
