Pregnant with the keys to your stick shift mood
Can't get yourself ignition
Can't get yourself ignition
Grease-stained parking spot
Embed and loiter bottle tops
Dipped in the secretion of your syphilis flirtation

Must we go
Spell it out?
Must we
Go spell it out?

Teething dressed in innuendo

Teething dressed in innuendo

Teething...

"C" is for contraction
Thirty minutes apart
Umbilical agendas
In the coup d'etat
"C" is for the cul de sac
Tienanmen reverse
Parking all the grandeur
In the backseat afterbirth

Grease-stained parking spot
L-l-l-loiter tops
The loiter tops
They're mine
They're dipped in the secretion
We are
Dipped in the secretion

Must we go
Spell it out for you and you and you and you?
Must we go spell it out?

Cradle
Teething dressed in innuendo

Teething dressed in innuendo

Teething dressed in innuendos

Mao Zedong fervor in his petty stained glance
(Do we?)
Do we gotta spell it out?
(Do we?)
Mao Zedong fervor in his petty stained glance
(Do we? Do we? Do we? Do we?)
His petty stained glance
Mao Zedong fervor in his lint tipton
(Do we? Do we? Do we? Do we?)
In this cursive dysentery
Mao Zedong fervor in his petty stained glance
(Do we? Do we? Do we? Do we?)
