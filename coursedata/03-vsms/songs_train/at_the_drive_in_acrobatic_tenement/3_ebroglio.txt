I had a friend who died for something he really loved
I had a friend who stood for none of the above
I had a friend whose experience was riddled with scars
Who got drunk one night in the trunk of Louie P.'s car
I had a friend who'd love to scare you, as was his affection
And tremble you did cause you weren't worthy of his friendship
I had a friend, but now he's stranded on the Mesa Street exit
And sometimes I'm jealous cause I'm still at the intersection
I had a friend whose heart was too heavy to hold
Yes, there's blood on the median like a boat without oars

Duct tape the cross on the brown colored box
Well single file line on the unpaved road
(The road)
Well they tipped their hats, respect for the dead
(The road)
In Juarez, Mexico is where they buried my friend

There are no words
To express the loss
I feel since you've been away
You made a typical sad song
A physical classroom
Where I learned nothing
Just flashes of your
Face
Just flashes of your
Face

And my solution is
It's all a facade
It's all a facade
It's all a facade
And nothing really matters
(No)

It's all a facade
It's all a facade
It's all a facade
But nothing really matters
(No)

It's all a facade
It's all a facade
I said it's all a facade
But nothing really matters now
(No)

It's all a facade
It's all a facade
I said it's all a facade

(The road)
Now he's stranded somewhere on the Mesa Street exit
(The road)
And sometimes I'm jealous 'cause I'm waiting at the intersection
(The road)
I had a friend whose heart was too heavy to hold
(Blood)
Yes, there's blood on the median like a boat without oars
(Go)

I had a friend whose heart was too heavy to hold
Too heavy to hold
Who'd felt too heavy to hold
And there's blood on the median like a boat without oars
Like a boat without oars

D-d-d-die

It's all a facade
It's all a facade
I said it's all a facade
But nothing really matters now
(No)

It's all a facade
It's all a facade
But it's all a facade
But nothing really matters now
(No)

It's all a facade
It's all a facade
It, it's all a facade
But nothing really matters now
(No)

It's all a facade
It's all a facade
I said it, it's all a facade
