I-N-I-T-I
A-T-I-O-N

Follow you home after every show
Perforated into tiny fragments
Heavy breathing's your new fan club
A John Hancock with the safety off
After every show
And how this pedestal fits like a glove
Such a pity I built no ladder from the roots
And above I'll be hacking off
After every show

(I-N-I-T-I-A-T-I-O-N.)
Initiation

(What!)
What you doing?

There's no restraining order to keep me from you
Yeah you
(Initiation.)
Yeah you

(What!)
Said, what you doing?

We outside never win

Parting contestants never seem to win

Watch you clap your hands by the stage
Lend me your ears for just another page
In the book that your friend signed yesterday
When I told you not to bother to holler
Your telephone's the one that helped
Me wrap
The cord
Around your neck
You know you're beautiful
When you're
Dead

(What!)
What you doing?

There's no restraining order to keep me from you
Yeah you
(Initiation.)
Yeah you

(What!)
What you doing?

There's no restraining order to keep me from you
(Initiation.)
Party protects us and every day fades away
