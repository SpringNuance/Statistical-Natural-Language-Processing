In a small ghost town, there's a little arcade
Where the poltergeists play their video games
(On the roof, he said)
"Game over," they said, "Game over," they said
Run and get your quarters in
(Over cliffs we will swim ahead)

Do the shackles underneath your bed haunt
The records in their grooves?
And he said "it's all over"
Salem is home sentenced to live
Yes, this I know, comes back tenfold, fold, fold

Run and get your quarters in

At the bottom of a French blue pool
Roamed the drunk chipped tooth of the man of the moon
At the top of the roof, he says
Burn furnace burn at the bottom of the cliff
Shined a diamond with no end to its trip
Over cliffs we will swim ahead

Do the shackles underneath your bed haunt
The records in their grooves?
And he said "it's all over"
Salem is home sentenced to live
Yes, this I know, comes back tenfold, fold, fold

Hook and sinker, hook and sinker
Hook and sinker, hook and sinker
I wrote it all down for you
Match a name to a face, do you suspect?
Do you confess, do you confess?

Home sentenced to live, Salem, yeah
Yes, this I know, comes back ten fold, fold, fold
