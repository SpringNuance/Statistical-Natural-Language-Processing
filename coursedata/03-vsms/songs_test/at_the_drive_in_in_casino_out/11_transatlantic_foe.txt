Pet sounds filling pet peeve voids
Black and white TV with the sound turned down
Is it mono or stereo?

Lending aneurysm satisfaction in the
Fruitless gaze of your Mona Lisa's lazy smile
Trick ourselves in portable stanzas
Black Russian throated on this guillotine cancer
How steep we are
But there's just no telling
Just no telling

Savion is under heel
Clicking Morse code through movie stills again
Savion is under heel
Clicking Morse code through movie stills again

The sky had blackened with carrion birds
Pinstriped suits and cigarettes
Tapped danced through this tepid burlesque
Their mouths were parched with excess thirst
Bridge and chorus candy curse
Still they sang through strepthroat verse

Pet sounds filling pet peeve voids
Black and white TV with the sound turned down
Is this mono or stereo?

If I had a dollar for every plot that you made
In this bed of nails we made
Trick ourselves in portable stanzas
Black Russian throated on this guillotine cancer
How steep we are
But there's just no telling
Just no telling

Pet sounds filling pet peeve voids
Black and white TV with the sound turned down
Like breathing blood through the lungs of a czar's child
Through the lungs of a czar's child
Through the lungs of a czar's child

Savion is under heel
Clicking Morse code through movie stills again
Savion is under heel
Clicking Morse code through movie stills again
Savion is under heel
Clicking Morse code through movie stills again
