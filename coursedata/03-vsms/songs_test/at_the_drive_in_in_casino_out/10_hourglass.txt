Sucks me in, taking a ride
And I'm wishing for the satellite
Grabbing vein pulling down on the radio
Laughing at the face that's bending down

I'm all alone so far up here
And my oxygen's all gone

Bend the metal, my glory box has failed
We're rocking in our reclining chairs
Drive away that car, that brought us all this harm
Those are the pieces of my story line

I'm all alone so far up here
And my oxygen's all gone

I'm all alone so far up here
And my oxygen's all gone

Truly stressing realization
I wish I was an astronaut
Eight hour bitterness, all for whose sake?
Stained glass Sunday school charades
