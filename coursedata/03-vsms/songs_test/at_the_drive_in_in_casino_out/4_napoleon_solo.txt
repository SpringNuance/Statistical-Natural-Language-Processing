Cut and paste, were you sitting down
On the beaded impotence of New Orleans?
A hint of suspense when that telephone rings
This is forever

It paved a wave of distance between the syntax error
From Austin's yellow brick road, this is forever
From this Texas breath exhaled, no sign of relief
'Cause this you know, this you know, this is forever

March Twenty-Third hushed the wind, the music died
If you can't get the best of us now
It's cause this is forever
March Twenty-Third hushed the wind, the music died (You know)
If you can't get the best of us now (You know)
(You know)
It's cause this is forever

Makes no difference, your alphabet is missing letters
Seventeen, embalmed, in caskets lowered into the weather
A drizzle, brisk and profound
From this Texas breath exhaled no sign of relief
This is forever

March Twenty-Third hushed the wind, the music died
If you can't get the best of us now
It's cause this is forever
March Twenty-Third hushed the wind, the music died (You know)
If you can't get the best of us now (You know)
(You know)
It's cause this is forever

Strum this broken harp
We were struck by the chords sent from their hearts
Yes, this is forever, this is forever

Cut and paste, were you sitting down
On the beaded impotence of New Orleans?
A hint of suspense when that telephone rings

This is forever, this is forever, this is forever
Makes no! Makes no! Makes no!
Seventeen, embalmed, in caskets lowered into the weather
A drizzle, brisk and profound
From this Texas breath exhaled

Strum this broken harp
We were struck by the chords sent from their hearts
This is forever, no turning back, this is forever
(You know, you know)
Yeah, this is forever, no turning back, this is forever
(You know that this is forever)
But you can't get the best of us now
