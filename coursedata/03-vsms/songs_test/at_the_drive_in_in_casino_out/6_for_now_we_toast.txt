Well, it's hit or miss upon the gate walls
Are the guards asleep, bayonet and all?
Well, the searchlight is coming
We built this tunnel, we shovel with our hands

Dig just a little bit, the camp is vast asleep
Library laundromats inside of dirty sheets
You've got to dig just a little bit

Soup kitchen feeds, lines of stubble and marrow
A book of matches guides us home
Do they have our scent? Will we go home?
We shovel with our hands

(Dig just a little bit, the camp is vast asleep
Library laundromat)
Live just a little bit, Dakota fields will beg
Meet you on the other side, dig just a little bit

(Dig just a little bit, the camp is vast asleep
Library laundromat)
Live just a little bit, Dakota fields will beg
Meet you on the other side, dig just a little bit

They steamrolled past the lobby
Did you trip on your shoelace untied?
It's in the past and now we toast

They steamrolled past the lobby
Did you trip on your shoelace untied?
It's in the past and now we toast

(Dig just a little bit, the camp is vast asleep
Library laundromat)
Live just a little bit, Dakota fields will beg
Meet you on the other side, Winnipeg's a forest
Where the search and seizure hid
Wanted for the crime of the disease that you give
