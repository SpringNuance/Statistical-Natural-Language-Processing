Widows, an antique replacement
A briefcase filled with mace
Widows, six legged lost and found
Students, spray the Kent State mace
Wishing wells, missing clientele
Widows, six legged lost and found
Parkas worn in summer apparel
Sweat lodge comatose of broken arrows

Widows, veiled in rebound sheets
This is the ghost of a chance the lonely
Widows, six legged lost and found
Precision, watch the scalpel make roads
Hear them talk in paranoid parables
Widows, six legged lost and found

Storefront chairman's fingering buttons
This running of the bulls
Will take over the life support system

Madrid space station Spain, in space, in space
Flesh versus machine
Matador is just a bull in a china shop

Gored my neck, don't spare me death
I'm running circles, red cape paper
Taste the vapor
