They say that thirteen's just a number
A double agent funded in the secret
Of the hive, their workers and their lives
All sweet and honeycombed
A hunger ravenous and funded
Incognito razor burns
Talcum powdered fingerprints
Sweet and honeycombed

Go stick your tongue on the North Pole
Read the graffiti splattered on the convertible
This bullet x-marked, rumors jet-lagged
Wink your eye, stab you with this pitchfork

Funded, funded, funded
All sweet and honeycombed
Funded, funded, funded
All sweet and honeycombed
Funded, funded, funded
All sweet and honeycombed
Funded, funded, funded

Part your hair on the grassy knoll
A cavity of candy in Havana captivity
We heard the mug shots, a patsy inclined
Let the pollen make you sneeze

All sweet and honeycombed
All sweet and honeycombed
All sweet and honeycombed
All sweet and honeycombed

Funded, funded, funded
All sweet and honeycombed
Funded, funded, funded
All sweet and honeycombed

Hasta la victoria siempre
Mañana hay misa para sordos
Hasta la victoria siempre
Mañana hay misa para sordos
Victoria siempre

Funded, funded, funded
All sweet and honeycombed
Funded, funded, funded
All sweet and honeycombed
Funded, funded, funded
All sweet and honeycombed
