In the humble stench of nativity
Hummed the smell of television snow
A faint S.O.S. flickering
Riding on the coattails of your ground zero

Neighborhood footprints ingrown
The daylight savings time will never know
Of this alabaster cold, of this alabaster

Your lovers quarrel ended up in a crawlspace
Dental identities will tell us apart
Teeth marked and bounded with sighs
Step into my parlor said the spider to the fly

Stable hoofed footprints ingrown
Cloak and dagger muzak blared in ohms
Of this alabaster cold
Of this alabaster cold
Of this alabaster cold
Ingrown! Ingrown!
Ingrown! Ingrown!
Ingrown! Ingrown!

More caliber per capita
Ingrown! Ingrown!

Neighborhood footprints ingrown
The daylight savings time will never know
Breakfast table search team implodes
The milk cartons that pour will never know
Of this alabaster cold
