Um...is that a wig?
I'm confused, is that a weave?
Is that your real hair?
No, you can't touch my fuckin hair! You ain't got no manners!
Oh my God!

It's mine, I bought it, it's mine, I bought it
It's mine, I bought it, it's mine, I bought it
It's mine, I bought it, it's mine, I bought it
It's mine, I bought it, it's mine, I bought it

I like the Dominicans who rock they weaves innocent
Shout out the Boricua girls who rock yaki ponytails
Big up to my Africans who braid, many hours spent
They own they own businesses and work while they care for kids
You know I love auntie girls with Sunday best bonnet curls
And love to my Asian chicks who make hair go straight as shit
I love how West Indies do, it's gossip with hair and food
I love how West Indies do, it's gossip with hair and food

Bundles, bundles, bundles, hit that plug up for the bundles
Beauty shop supply, cashier ringin' up them numbers
Rock my many styles then go natural for the summer
Hair blowin' in the hummer, flip the weave, I am a stunner

It's mine, I bought it, it's mine, I bought it
It's mine, I bought it, it's mine, I bought it
It's mine, I bought it, it's mine, I bought it

Look how I stunt, look how I stunt
Look how I stunt, look how I stunt, in my lace front
10's to the floor, 10's through the door
10's to your face, 5, you a bore
Pick up the pace, spit in your face
Dawson, your creek, Joey to pace
Glue in my weave, Ms. Destiny
Lil Banji, bruise on my knee
Dip on the dip, makin' a trip
Wanna talk slick, I blow them a kiss
Glue in my weave, Ms. Destiny
Lil Banji, bruise on my knee

Please do not ask me or any Black or Brown women if our hair is real or not. If it’s a wig, a weave, extensions, braids, don’t fuckin' ask. It’s very rude, it’s extremely personal to be put on the spot like that. How we choose to wear our hair is our personal choice, ok? We bought it, it’s ours, so have some manners and keep your curiosity to yourself
