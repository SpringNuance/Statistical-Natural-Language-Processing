I'm the supreme, I'm the supreme

We is them ghetto witches, speakin' in tongue bitches
Fall on the floor, got sage on the door
We is them ghetto witches, speakin' in tongue bitches
Fall on the floor, got sage on the door
We is them ghetto witches, speakin' in tongue bitches
Fall on the floor, got sage on the door
We is them ghetto witches, speakin' in tongue bitches
Fall on the floor, got sage on the door

Talk shit, we can cast spells, long weaves, long nails
Corn rows, pig tails, baby fathers still in jail
Good witches, I fuck with, bad bitches, we run shit
Four bitches, four corners, North, East, West, South shit
Good witches, I fuck with, hopped off of my broomstick
Witchcraft, bitch craft, light magic, it's nothing

Orisha, my altar
Orisha, my altar
Orisha, my altar
Got coins on the counter

I'm that Black a-Rican bruja straight out from the Yoruba
And my people come from Africa diaspora, Cuba
And you mix that Arawak, that original people
I'm that Black Native American, I vanquish all evil
I'm that Black a-Rican bruja straight out from the Yoruba
And my ancestors Nigerian, my grandmas was brujas
And I come from an island and it's called Puerto Rico
And it's one of the smallest but it got the most people

Orisha, my altar
Orisha, my altar
Orisha, my altar
Got coins on the counter
Got coins on the counter

Don't you fuck with my energy
Don't you fuck with my energy
Don't you fuck with my energy
Don't you fuck with my energy
Don't you fuck with my energy
Don't you fuck with my energy
Don't you fuck with my energy
Don't you fuck with my energy

Castin' spells with my cousins, I'm the head of this coven
I'm a shapeshiftin' bitch, you don't know who you lovin'
Better light you a candle, I heard the nighttime was black
And if you don't watch your step the greatest bitch will be back
I cast a circle in white and I can vanquish your spite
And if you hex me with hate then I'ma conjure the light
Your evil ways put no fight, I ain't no queen of the night
I'm a bruja, I'm a bruja, and I'ma dress in all white

I'm the supreme, I'm the supreme
I'm the supreme, I'm the supreme
I'm the supreme, I'm the supreme
I'm the supreme, I'm the supreme

Tituba! Voodoo slave girl who graced us with her black magic
You made her a slave
Before that she came from a great tribe, the Arawak
She gave it to your girls of Salem
A gift repaid with betrayal
Maybe you ain't heard the news about civilization starting in Africa
We more than just pins in dolls and seeing the future in chicken parts
Been reading too many tourist guides, hm
Everything you got, you got from us
