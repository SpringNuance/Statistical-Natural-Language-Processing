With my little titties and my phat belly
I could take your man if you finna let me
It's a guarantee that he won't forget me
My body little, my soul is heavy
My little titties be bookin' cities
All around the world, they be fuckin' wit' me
I'm a Calvin Klein model, come and get me
Step the resy up, don't be fuckin' with me
My little titties are so itty bitty
I go locomotive, chitty chitty, bang bang
Gold hoops and that name chain
Timb boots and like, four rings
Missy Elliott, can't stand the rain
You lames playin' the same games
Little titties, I'm so damn pretty
Staircase and a cracked philly
Little titties and a phat kitty
Big pants and some scuffed shoes
Pow-pow-pow, Blue's Clues
(Pow pow pow! Pow pow!)

[Bridge]

He so in love, he think it's a spell
There's levels to magic and he cannot tell
He fuck with my bruja, my pussy a spell
My toto is special, got locks like a jail
It's Polo, it's Tommy, it's Mecca, it's Nauti
I'm finna sit back and just sip on Bacardi
You come to my party, you gon' meet my army
A room full of girls and we actin' real rowdy
