Rotten apple to the core, damn, I been a fuck up
Gettin' picked for last in gym, I can't even do a lay up
Writing on my sneakers, being sneaky with my teachers
Smokin' weed under the bleachers, cuttin' out and gluein' pictures
Carryin' my CD player, suckin' on a Now or Later
Sour Apple was the flavor, scribblin' on doodle paper
Tryin' hard to pay attention but I have no real direction
So I say, "yo, fuck this lesson," spark the leaf, my back is stressin'
Who I am and where I'm headed, cuttin' school and actin' crazy
Foster care done got me crazy, living with a crazy lady
Every day I'm always late, puffin' on a skimpy J
Staying in my grandma house, wasn't even far away
But I guess that's what I do, makin' life more difficult for me and you

Ay caramba
Bart Simpson with the shits
Ay caramba, man, you can go and suck my dick
Skatin' down the street, being mischievous as shit
This as good as it gon' get, always cheat on yo' tests
Don't you be like the rest, I ain't no teacher's pet

Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
If that don't work then, deny, deny, deny
Lookin' to my future is like lookin' at the sky
Inner city orphan with my hand in apple pie
A liar, a schemer, a cheater, I do it all
I used to switch schools each comin' fall
I skipped all my classes and still managed to pass them all
Readin' comics in Forbidden Planet
I go home to a place of fantasy outside my own
Always been a loner, never had a solid home
I really like Marvel 'cause characters look just like me
And women don't have roles that make them look too sexually
I lie a lot from gettin' beaten and put off food, I'm not eatin'
Eczema so bad I'm bleedin', but I smile and keep it cheesin'
A nerdy girl with nymphomaniac tendencies
Everyone's offended but nobody here offended me
90's mami dressin' like Aaliyah, quite apparently
I'm heavy with the theory, I move with the groove
I'm Black like Shaolin, I tang with the Wu
Africa, my guy, with the bantu do
I'm stupid, fuckin' crazy nuts, loose like a screw
See, I know my money, got raised by the Jews
I'm a New York Puerto Rican like a rough kinda dude
I'ma hit the barrio and eat some Spanish food
And sit in Central Park, I'm in a New York mood

Bart Simpson with the shits
Ay caramba, man, you can go and suck my dick
Skatin' down the street, being mischievous as shit
This as good as it gon' get, always cheat on yo' tests
Don't you be like the rest, I ain't no teacher's pet, uh
Don't you be like the rest, I ain't no teacher's pet, uh
