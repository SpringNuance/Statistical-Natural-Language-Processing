Ambitions and accolades, what did you go do today?
How did you go spend your day? I work hard, I'm gettin' paid
My schedule was full today, I'm 'bout to go all the way
I set off and hit the stage, ready to go do my thing
Well baby, my day was good, I worked hard and knocked on wood
I skipped meals and got no sleep but this was the life for me
You workin', Ms. Destiny, you workin', Ms. Destiny
You workin', Ms. Destiny, you workin', Ms. Destiny

Go 'head, bitch, go do ya thing
You perfect in every way, you move past when others stay
You make moves and play the game
Ms. D, I'm already queen, I put that on everything
My mama she raised me good, I'm chic but I'm always hood
My manners impeccable, I'm always respectable
There's eloquence in my speech, I practice but never preach
My name is Ms. Destiny, I go hard in everything
I bring out the best in me and do what is best for me
I excel, I'm excellent, my melanin's heaven sent
Got all of my haters bent, they gag, and I'm still content
