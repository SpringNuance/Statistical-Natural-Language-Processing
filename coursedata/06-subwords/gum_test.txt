L'Enfant was recruited by Pierre Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais to serve in the American Revolutionary War in the United States .
He arrived in 1777 at the age of 23 , and served as a military engineer in the Continental Army with Major General Lafayette .
He was commissioned as a captain in the Corps of Engineers on April 3 , 1779 to rank from February 18 , 1778 .
Despite his aristocratic origins , L'Enfant closely identified with the United States , changing his first name from Pierre to Peter when he first came to the rebelling colonies in 1777 .
L'Enfant served on General George Washington 's staff at Valley Forge .
While there , the Marquis de Lafayette commissioned L'Enfant to paint a portrait of Washington .
He was wounded at the Siege of Savannah on October 9 , 1779 .
He recovered and became a prisoner of war at surrender of Charleston , South Carolina on May 12 , 1780 .
He was exchanged in November 1780 and served on General George Washington 's staff for the remainder of the American Revolution .
L'Enfant was promoted by brevet to Major in the Corps of Engineers on May 2 , 1783 , in recognition of his service to the cause of American liberty .
He was discharged when the Continental Army was disbanded in December 1783 .
After the war , L'Enfant designed the badge of the Society of the Cincinnati , an organization of former officers of the Continental Army , shaped as an eagle , at the request of Washington .
He was sent to France to have insignias made for members of the Society , a group of veterans of the war .
Career
Post–Revolutionary War
Following the American Revolutionary War , L'Enfant established a successful and highly profitable civil engineering firm in New York City .
He achieved some fame as an architect by redesigning the City Hall in New York for the First Congress of the United States ( See : Federal Hall ) .
He also designed furniture and houses for the wealthy as well as coins and medals , including the insignia of the Society of the Cincinnati .
He was also a friend of Alexander Hamilton , and some of their correspondances from 1790 to 1801 now reside in the National Archives .
While L'Enfant was in New York City , he was initiated into Freemasonry .
His initiation took place on April 17 , 1789 , at Holland Lodge No. 8 , F&AM , which the Grand Lodge of New York F&AM had chartered in 1787 .
L'Enfant took only the first of three degrees offered by the Lodge and did not progress further in Freemasonry .
Mérida
Mérida is the capital of the state of Yucatán in Mexico .
It has a population of about 750,000 , and is the largest city in the Yucatán Peninsula .
Catedral de San Ildefonso
Zócalo or Main Plaza , with the Cathedral in the distance
Understand
Mérida is a city of contrasts .
You will find elegant hotels , restaurants and malls in the northern part of the city .
Downtown , there are hotels and restaurants to suit every budget .
A large central market and numerous small shops are found all around the main plaza .
Mérida has a rich cultural life which also reflects its diversity .
Many free concerts , performances and other events are held daily .
The city was founded by the Spanish conquistadors in the 1540s on top of a centuries-old Maya city called T'ho .
The palatial home of the family of conquistador leader Montejo can still be seen on the south side of the Zócalo or main square .
Here and there bits of ancient Maya stonework can be seen reused in Spanish Colonial era buildings in the old part of town .
From the later 1800s to the 1920s Mérida enjoyed prosperous boom times fueled by the henequen or sisal plant harvest , which made Yucatán the rope maker to the world .
Progressive Mérida had electric trams and street lights before Mexico City .
The wealthy constructed the grand Pasejo Montejo avenue north of the old town , inspired by the Champs-Élysées in Paris .
With the development of artificial twines the sisal boom ended , and Mérida slowed to a more sleepy provincial capital until development picked back up in the late 20th century .
The city 's ambiance is colonial and the climate is tropical .
The daytime temperature varies ; in January , it is about 24 ° C ( 75 ° F ) and in June , about 35 ° C ( 95 ° F ) .
To beat the heat , most people are busiest in the mornings .
They have lunch and siesta , then go back to work for a few hours in the late afternoon .
The cool breezes from the Gulf of Mexico drift into Mérida in the evenings and this is when many of the residents spend their time outdoors .
You can see them visiting and talking as they stroll along the streets , sit in the plazas or dine in the many sidewalk restaurants .
From Mérida , it is easy to take day trips to a vast array of destinations : archaeological sites , ecological parks , typical villages , caves , beaches , colonial missions and more .
Take your time and really explore the Maya sites , walk for miles along the Gulf of Mexico , attend a village festival , photograph the wildlife , crawl through a cave or swim in a cenote .

Australian children suffering from iodine deficiency
Thursday , February 23 , 2006
Almost half of all Australian primary school children are mild to moderately iodine deficient , researchers say .
A new study documenting iodine nutritional status in Australian school children has revealed many are not getting enough iodine - which can lead to mental and growth retardation .
The report 's authors say iodine deficiency is " the sleeper health issue in Australia " , and potentially a very serious one .
The results of the Australian National Iodine Nutrition Study published in the Medical Journal of Australia this week , revealed that children in mainland Australia are borderline iodine deficient .
The report has prompted calls for all edible salt to be iodised .
They say adding the mineral to salt is the simplest and most effective method of preventing iodine deficiency disorders .
A cross-sectional survey of 1709 schoolchildren - aged 8 – 10 years , from 88 schools - was carried out in New South Wales , Victoria , South Australia , Western Australia and Queensland , between July 2003 and December 2004 .
Tasmania was excluded from the study - where an voluntary iodine fortification program using iodised salt in bread , is ongoing .
The authors say the results confirm the existence of inadequate iodine intake in the Australian population .
They call for " urgent implementation of mandatory iodisation of all edible salt in Australia . "
Most iodine in food comes from seafood , milk and iodised salt .
Professor Cres Eastman , Director of the National Iodine Nutrition study , and Chairman of the Australian Centre for Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders , says it is crucial that children and pregnant women in particular have an adequate intake of iodine .
Iodine deficiency can lead to serious health problems including brain damage , stunted growth and deafness .
Professor Eastman says manufacturers could easily remedy the situation by using iodised salt in their products in line with the United States and most European countries .
" I suspect they wo n't do that on a voluntary basis , we 've tried so far and have n't succeeded , so we 've convinced the Food Standards of Australia and New Zealand | that all salt should be iodised , " he said .
The report says the decline in iodine intake appears to be due to changes in the dairy industry , where chlorine-containing sanitisers have replaced iodine-containing sanitisers .
Iodine released from these chemicals into milk has been the major source of dietary iodine in Australia for at least four decades , but is now declining .
Another contributory factor has been the decreasing consumption of iodised salt used in foods .
The report states that few if any food manufacturers use iodised salt in the preparation and manufacture of foods .
Professor Eastman says iodine is added to only 10 per cent of Australian salt in contravention of a World Health Organisation recommendation that all salt be iodised .
He says authorities are reacting slowly to his urgent calls for mandatory iodised salt .
" The effects of iodine deficiency are dependent upon how severe it is and when it occurs .
So if we go to the pregnant woman , she does n't get enough iodine , she wo n't make enough thyroid hormone , and the foetus wo n't get the amount of thyroid hormone it needs for adequate and proper development of the brain , so you 'll then see consequences being loss of IQ , learning difficulties , hearing difficulties and other neurological problems , " Professor Eastman said .
" If an infant 's not getting enough iodine ... brain development wo n't be completed and they wo n't grow normally , and as you get older the problem will be that you will develop a goiter and your thyroid wo n't function as well as it should , so that may have all sorts of pernicious effects upon normal function in life . "
More than two billion people around the world live in areas prone to iodine deficiency , and yet the problem is easily fixed .
The World Health Organisation ( WHO ) recommends that every country should iodise all edible salt .
The most well known effects of IDD are visible goiter and cretinism , a condition characterised by severe brain damage occurring in very early life .
WHO say Iodine deficiency is the world ’s most prevalent , yet easily preventable , cause of brain damage .
Professor Eastman said he is alarmed by what they found .
" Pregnant women in Australia are getting about half as much as what they require on a daily basis .
So that alarms me , because there 's quite serious potential for adverse effects and brain damage in the next generation of children born in this country , " he said .
" If Iodine deficiency is serious you lose 15 IQ points , on average .
There should n't be anyone suffering from iodine deficiency in a developed country like Australia . "
Lydia Buchtmann for Food Standards Australia New Zealand , says they are looking at mandatory guidelines on iodine by the end of the year .
She says the issue is complicated and will take time to get right .
We need to " make sure there 's sufficient iodine added into the food supply , to help those people with a deficiency .
But at the other end of the scale we 've got to make sure the people who eat a lot of food - we all know the teenage boy who comes home from school and eats a whole loaf of bread - that those people do n't get too much and get overdose , " Ms Bauchtman said .
" One of the reasons that iodine is going down is because people are taking that good healthy eating message and not adding salt during cooking . "
Senior researcher Mu Li , of the University of NSW 's school of public health , said " it is reasonable to assume that pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers are also iodine deficient , putting the next generation of children born in this country at risk of the neuropsychological consequences of iodine deficiency . "
Vava’u is a group of more than 50 islands in Tonga , about 150 miles north of Tongatapu .
They are either raised coral limestone or coral atolls .
The beautiful harbour opposite the main town of Neiafu ( known as the Port of Refuge Harbour ) is a common destination for yachties sailing the South Pacific .
The waters of the islands are known for their clarity , it being said that you can see the bottom at 40 metres .
The area attracts many humpback whales between June and November and there are lots of companies organising tours to see them .
There are numerous places to stay to suit most budgets .
Understand
Findings of Lapita pottery suggest that early-Polynesians were on these islands close to 3000 years ago .
These days there are around 20000 people living in the Group .
Neiafu and surrounding villages are home to about a third of the Group ’s overall population of around 20000 , with the majority of the population living in small villages on the other islands .
Neiafu is the official port of entry for yachts coming to Vava'u , which attracts over 500 yachts every winter sailing season between June and October .
A string of islands and reefs along the eastern edge of the Group shelters the area from strong winds and ocean swellS and humpback whales come to these protected waters to give birth .
This is the high season for tourism ;
between December and April few people visit and many tour companies and restaurants close down .
Neiafu town is the centre of activity .
It is on the southern point of the main island of Utu Vava'u and has an attractive setting on one of the world 's most beautiful harbours .
Neiafu offers all the usual amenities including banks , schools , tour companies , restaurants , cafes and bars , supermarkets , a market and a hospital .
It does n't have a beach but boats to one of the nearby coral atolls with superb sandy beaches are easily available .
Climate
Vava'u has a tropical climate with average temperatures up to 29 ºC in January and down to 24 ºC in June .
It is sunny throughout the year .
Between November and April , it is more humid and thunderstorms and cyclones do occur .
From May to September there are southeast trade winds but during the summer months the winds are from the northeast .

How to Grow Beavertail Cactus
The Beavertail Cactus ( Opunitia basilares ) , found primarily in the Mojave Desert and northwest Mexico ; can grow to be about 24 inches ( 60 cm ) high ; has pads that look like beavertails ; and yields red or purple flowers from spring to early summer .
Growing Beavertail can be done at any time of year by scattering seeds in a shady bed or , for faster results , planting cuttings in a mix of soil and sand and ensuring that they have a bit of water and plenty of sun .
Read the following steps to find out how to grow Beavertail cactus .
Method 1 of 2 : From Seeds
Purchase Beavertail cactus seeds .
These can be bought at garden centers or purchased online .
Scatter the seeds .
In a shady garden bed , simply scatter the seeds on the soil .
There 's no need to cover them , unless you want to use netting to keep the birds off .
Keep the soil moist until the seeds germinate .
Make sure that the garden bed is in the shade .
Beavertail cacti seeds need shade to grow , whereas cuttings need plenty of direct sunlight .
Be aware that growing Beavertail cactus from seeds takes much longer than growing one from a cutting .
It can take as long as 4 to 4 years before you get flowers .
Method 2 of 2 : From Cuttings
Obtain Beavertail cuttings .
You can purchase them online or at a local garden center .
If you already own a Beavertail cactus , you can make your own cuttings .
To do this , choose pads ( the flat , oval-shaped sections that make up a cactus ) that are 6 months old or older and cut them at the base .
In order to form a callous and prevent rot , cure the cuttings by sitting the pad upright in a dry , dark place for 10 to 14 days .
Plant the cuttings .
Prepare a potting mix that is equal parts soil and rough pumice or sand and fill the appropriate number of pots with it .
Make sure there are holes in the center of the base of each pot to allow for good drainage .
Set the cuttings upright in the potting mix about an inch ( 2.5 cm. ) deep .
If you plant the cuttings too deep , they might rot .
Put some rocks around the pad to anchor it in place .
Choose a spot for your Beavertail cactus cuttings .
If you live in an area with strong summer sun , position the cuttings so that the broad sides of the cuttings face east and west while the slim sides face north and south .
This will prevent the cuttings from burning during the hottest part of the day .
Make sure the spot is sheltered from any cold winter winds .
Wait for a month .
Do not water the cutting for the first month .
The moisture in the pad will provide enough nutrients for roots to grow .
Too much water might cause rot .
After 1 month , roots will have sprouted and you can water the cutting for the first time .
Always let the soil dry before you water the cuttings .
Once fully rooted , they are extremely drought resistant .
Fertilize the plants .
During the spring , summer , and fall , the Beavertail cactus grows and will benefit from a balanced fertilizer .
Let the cuttings grow .
From the first pad , many more will form .
The second or third pad will bear some flowers , but wait before harvesting them or you might affect the size of future harvests .
Theodorus of Tabennese
Theodorus of Tabennese ( c. 314 – 368 ) , also known as Abba Theodorus and Theodore the Sanctified was the spiritual successor to Pachomius and played a crucial role in preventing the first Christian cenobitic monastic federation from collapsing after the death of its founder .
Icon of St. Theodorus of Tabennese
Biography
According to hagiography , Theodorus was born into a wealthy Christian family and was well educated from a young age .
Early in life he denied the excesses of his parents , and at the age of fourteen joined a monastery in the diocese of Sne , near the modern town of Esna , Egypt .
A brother from Theodorus ’ monastery stayed with Pachomius in Tabennese while traveling and preached of the virtues of the Koinonia upon his return to Sne .
Praying and weeping , Theodorus became determined that his destiny lay with Pachomius .
Although initially denied passage to Tabennese by a Pachomian monk due to his wealthy background , Theodorus opted to follow the visiting monk , and his persistence ( and lack of obedience ) paid off .
He was welcomed by Pachomius upon his arrival , and quickly integrated into the community at Tabennese around 328 .
Quickly becoming a favorite of Pachomius , Theodorus lived an enviably ascetic life in the monastery , and took on the title of the " brothers ’ comforter " .
Theodorus asserted his influence openly ( which resulted in reprimands from Pachomius ) and generally maintained himself as a prominent figure at Tabennese for several years , despite never being given a position of power in the monastic hierarchy .
Finally , Pachomius called on him to preach to the brothers despite his youth , and eventually appointed him steward of Tabennese after several new monasteries had been built .
Retiring to the monastery of Phbow , Pachomius gave Theodorus complete control over Tabennese , though recalled him from the position after witnessing several monks under Theodorus ’ watch violating the monastic rules without reprimand .
Having failed to prove his governing ability and once more in a position no higher than when he had entered the monastery , Theodorus became a personal assistant to Pachomius and remained relatively quiet for some years .
Despite his clear potential and popularity , Pachomius refused to grant Theodorus any kind of authority ; though the old man 's failing health soon changed things forever .
After Theodorus had been assisting Pachomius at Tabennese for several years following his demotion , Pachomius became very ill and seemed to be on the verge of death .
Pachomius had not named a successor , and several brothers pleaded with Theodorus to assert himself as head of the Koinonia when the sickly man died .
Despite the assertion that Theodorus apparently did not want the rank of a father or this world 's glory , he consented .
Unfortunately for the would-be leader , Pachomius recovered , and upon hearing of Theodorus ’ decision , exiled the ambitious young man .
After living a life of constant weeping and prayer in solitude , Pachomius forgave Theodorus and allowed him to live among the brothers once more .
Normalcy returned , though never again would Pachomius fully trust his former protégé .
In 348 Pachomius died , naming the brother Petronios as his successor rather than the clearly qualified Theodorus .
The death of Petronios later that year would leave Apa Horsiesios in charge , and the popular Theodorus would retreat to the distant monastery of Phnoum .
Although it seems Theodorus practiced complete submission to the new leader of the Koinonia , problems soon arose in several Pachomian monasteries that viewed Horsiesios as a weak leader .
Refusing to work or communicate and demanding a new leader , many of the elder monks completely abandoned any notion of obedience to Horsiesios .
The federation of monasteries was falling apart , and Theodorus rushed to Tabennese to placate the rebels .
Soon after his arrival , Theodorus was the new de facto leader , though he claimed to be only acting on behalf of Horsiesios .
For eighteen years Theodorus administered from Pachomius ’ old headquarters in Phbow , using techniques far more assertive than his predecessors , such as constantly shuffling the offices and locations of the most ambitious monks .
Yet in spite of this somewhat unstable shifting , the Koinonia was ruled peacefully for nearly two decades , at which point Theodorus predicted he would soon die .
Within a few months his prediction came true , and Apa Horsiesios once more took his place as the head of the communities in both title and authority . [ 1 ]
Australian woman claims Church of Scientology imprisoned her for twelve years
Thursday , May 7 , 2015
Valeska Paris , an Australian woman and former Scientologist , has claimed that the Church of Scientology imprisoned her for twelve years aboard the Scientology - owned cruise ship , Freewinds .
The Church of Scientology 's cruise ship Freewinds in Bonaire .
Paris was born in Switzerland but her parents moved her to the United Kingdom when she was six so they could be closer to the church 's headquarters .
She joined the Sea Org aged 14 .
In 1995 , at age seventeen , she was told to disconnect from her mother .
Paris claims she was first sent to the ship aged eighteen for two weeks as a teenager but ended up spending twelve years there .
Paris also claims that her passport was taken away from her and she was forced to work in the engine room .
I was basically hauled in and told that my mum had attacked the church and that I needed to disconnect from her because she was suppressive . Valeska Paris
I was basically hauled in and told that my mum had attacked the church and that I needed to disconnect from her because she was suppressive .
Her mother had spoken out against Scientology on French television after her ex-husband and Paris 's father , Albert Jaquier , committed suicide after he lost his fortune to Scientology .
Paris claims that she was kept at Flag Land Base in Clearwater , Florida until she was eighteen and then transferred to the Freewinds .
On board the Freewinds , Paris claims that she was working from 6:00am to midnight and due to lack of sleep ended up being a walking zombie .
She also claims that in 1997 and 1998 , she was tasked with removal of asbestos from the ship .
In 2007 , Paris left the ship after a confrontation with the ship 's management .
She was eventually sent to Rehabilitation Project Force in Sydney , which the Church describes as a religious retreat , but critics charge is a forced work camp .
Here , she met her future husband and subsequently left the church .
In a statement to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation , the Church denied these allegations :
She certainly was n't ' forced ' to be there .
She was also never forced to perform labour in the engine room .
They also claimed Paris was a volunteer and claim she has a vested interest for misrepresenting her experiences with the Church .
The Church also claims that Paris not having her passport was maritime procedure .
How to Make Skittles Vodka
Three Methods : Single Serving ( 25 mL Shot )
Bottles of " Skittled "
Vodka Dishwasher Bottle Method
Making Skittles vodka is a fun way to add a splash of fruity flavor and color to regular vodka .
All you need to do is place your favorite combination of Skittles candies into a glass or bottle of vodka and wait for it to infuse .
You can then use your Skittles vodka to make brightly-colored cocktails or even serve it as a sugary shot !
Find multiple methods for making Skittles vodka after the jump -- and soon you 'll be tasting the rainbow !
Ingredients
A handle ( 1.75 liters , about a half gallon ) of vodka per bag of Skittles
A large bag of Skittles candy ( the " movie size " bag )
Method 1 of 3 : Single Serving ( 25 mL Shot )
Separate the colors of Skittles that you want to flavor the vodka with .
Many people choose to leave out the green , which is lime if you 're using original Skittles , and purple , which is grape in the original style , as they can create a weird taste combination or a less than appealing color for the final product .
However , you can put them in if you want .
If you do n't mind mixed flavors , you can just skip this step altogether .
Add six Skittles to 25 ml of vodka .
Keep swirling the mixture until the Skittles are almost completely dissolved .
Note that the ratio of Skittles to vodka varies from recipe to recipe .
You should experiment to find your preferred mix before making larger bottles .
Filter out the remaining Skittle " insides " .
With single servings like this , you can decide which flavor(s) you like best and proceed to making bottles , if you desire .
Method 2 of 3 : Bottles of " Skittled " Vodka
Pour out some vodka from a bottle to make room for Skittles .
Separate the Skittles by color .
Add the Skittles ( 20 - 25 per 350 ml / 11.8 fl oz ) .
Let the mixture sit for a day or two .
Shake occasionally so the flavour mixes well .
Strain out the Skittles using a filter , such as a paper coffee filter or a clean t-shirt .
Refrigerate overnight .
Method 3 of 3 : Dishwasher Bottle Method
Separate the colors from five bags of 200 g Skittles .
Using 5 x 700 ml / 23.6 fl oz bottles , pour 300 ml / 10.1 fl oz of vodka into a jug and fill each bottle with skittles .
Place the bottles in your dishwasher and put on an intensive cycle .
One third of of the way through the cycle , shake all bottles vigorously .
Two thirds of the way through the cycle , shake all bottles vigorously .
Once the cycle has finished , shake all bottles vigorously again .
Then place in the freezer for 2 hours .
Once the vodka is cold , it should be syrupy .
Take a sieve , line it with a piece of cheesecloth ( muslin ) or a coffee filter , place above a large jug and pour the vodka through slowly .
Once the first bottle has been filtered , wash out the bottle and pour the Skittles vodka back in .
Repeat the above two steps for all bottles , ensuring that everything is cleaned between uses to prevent color contamination .
Place all of the bottles in the freezer until you are ready to drink .
Do n't worry , the vodka wo n't freeze .
You are finished .
Enjoy your tasty creation .
Tips .
If you want to make it more quickly , cut the skittles in half before putting them into vodka .
Shake every 15 minutes .
They 'll dissolve in an hour instead of a day .
Or you could just scoop them out when the color dissolves .
Start with small amount of vodka and Skittles at first to experiment which combination of taste suits you best .
You can carry this out with larger amount of vodka and Skittles once you have decided that you enjoy the taste .
The lime green Skittles add a sourness to the drink , so if you want one that 's sweet , leave the green ones out and add them to their own bottle for a sour lime vodka .
Another approach is to buy five bottles of vodka and five bags of Skittles .
Then separate the candy and use one flavor for each bottle .
( Or get four bottles and an empty , to allow room for the skittles . )
If using a t-shirt to strain , be sure fabric softener or a dryer sheet had not been used with it , lets you get some extra ( unwanted ) flavoring ( and potentially toxic chemicals ) .
Warnings
Drink responsibly .
Never drink and drive .
Know your limits , and do not drink to the extent of intoxication .
Do not drink if underage in your country .
Things You 'll Need
Each handle of vodka ( 1.75 liters , about a half gallon ) requires a large bag worth of Skittles , so if you plan on doing only one flavor for a flavorful vodka , you 'll have to buy 5 large bags of Skittles .
Coffee filter , cheesecloth / muslin , or an extremely clean T-shirt
Large funnel or strainer to hold filter
How to Play Muggle Quidditch
In the Harry Potter series written by JK Rowling the main wizarding sport is Quidditch .
However you do n't have to have magical powers to play .
There are many different ways of playing Quidditch , but the most commonly used set of rules are those given by the International Quidditch Association ( which can be found here ) .
In the past Muggle Quidditch has mainly been played at colleges in the US , but over the last few years there has been a dramatic rise in the number of community teams .
Quidditch has also spread outside of America and is now played on 5 continents .
Steps
Gather all needed materials and players ( see Things You 'll Need section below ) .
Know that all players can play while riding a broom .
Brooms can be a hindrance however , so feel free to not use brooms .
Place the quaffle and three bludgers in the middle of the field .
Ideally the quaffle and bludgers should be slightly deflated so that they are easier to throw and catch .
Start the game .
Both teams start from the edges and attempt to obtain the quaffle and bludgers .
Follow your duty depending what type of player you are :
Chasers try to score by throwing the quaffle into one of the three goal hoops .
Each score is worth 10 points .
Beaters try to peg players with their bludger .
If a player is pegged they have to stop what they 're doing and pay a penalty ; i.e. ( drop the quaffle in the case of a chaser ) and run back to and touch their goal post or alternatively sit down for 10 seconds .
Keepers guard the goal posts at each end and attempt to block chasers ' attempts at scoring .
If Keeper is close to their hoops they are safe from being hit by bludgers .
Seekers try to tackle the snitch ( a person ) or obtain an object attached to the snitch such as a sock or flag .
You can establish you own rules as to how a player catches the snitch .
A common way to play is to make the snitch a person , and give the snitch a head start to run and hide in defined boundaries .
Then the seekers search for the snitch , and attempt to tag the player .
Other methods , such as the method adopted in 2005 , makes the snitch a tennis ball in a sock , hanging out of the running shorts of the snitch runner .
Regardless of method , the winning seeker wins 30 points for his or her team , unlike the books , in which the snitch is worth 150 points .
The creators of Muggle Quidditch thought that it was worth too many points so changed the value of the snitch for muggle Quidditch .
The snitch , generally a track runner , runs around ( usually the boundaries ) trying to evade the seekers .
The referee should ensure that rules are being followed .
They also keep track of the score .
Play the game !
The object of the game is to score the most points and the game ends when the seeker snatches the snitch .
Feel free to alter the game rules .
See the Tips section for suggestions .

How to Play a Real-Life Game of Quidditch
You do n't need flying broomsticks or magic balls to play this version of the game - it 's tailor-made for muggles like us .
This video shows a more realistic approach to playing Quidditch .
Tips
Alternatively the snitch can be a small yellow ball ( tennis balls work great ) that is hidden before the game starts by a bystander or referee .
Establish boundaries and have the seekers look for the snitch .
Beaters can try hitting the bludgers around in the air with a shortened hockey sticks or a short bat .
They could also use regular-length hockey sticks to hit bludgers ( perhaps wiffle balls ) on the ground .
The simplest way is to just peg players by throwing dodge balls .
It may be easier to play without brooms ( but also less fun ! ) .
Remember that the snitch runner , if you choose to use one , is not an actual player in the game , therefore , not bound by any of the rules .
If desired , the snitch is able to do whatever he or she wants to avoid capture .
See How to Be a Snitch in Quidditch for more information .
You can play water quidditch in a pool .
Almost all the same rules apply .
Have someone throw something ( the snitch ) on a line into the pool at regular intervals .
They can even use fake snitches .
You can buy authentic looking brooms to make the game more realistic .
There is a very large Quidditch community , have a look at the IQA website to find teams near you .
One variation is Quarter Snitch Quidditch .
Find a quarter or another small coin .
Have both of the teams turn around and have the referee throw it into the grass or pitch while the teams are n't looking .
Play while the seekers look for the snitch .
Another variation is where the referee places the snitch somewhere in the field ( in this case it 's a small ball ) .
The seeker has to find the snitch blindfolded , relying only on the coach 's instructions , while the game is still on .
Warnings
Stay hydrated and exercise wisely .
A ball flying in the air can hurt .
If you 're playing quidditch you 're probably just having fun so play nicely .

15 players
14 brooms
Field ( or big backyard )
3 goal hoops per team
Referee ( optional )
Color coded shirts or capes for houses , black for referee

The Onion : An interview with ' America 's Finest News Source '
Sunday , November 25 , 2007
How The Onion writes an issue
This exclusive interview features first-hand journalism by a Wikinews reporter .
See the collaboration page for more details .
How do you decide on the stories ?
We do everything backwards here .
We start with the headline and then flesh out the story , as opposed to The New York Times , which writes the issue and then has a headline editor to make it snappy .
We start with a joke .
We read about six hundred to eight hundred headline ideas on a Monday coming from our staff and a small group of writers outside — a contributing core .
We whittle that down on a Monday to about a hundred , come in Tuesday and pick an issue and brainstorm with the whole editorial staff ; all fifteen of us .
Then we assign a headline to a specific writer to execute .
We go through a number of drafts and then have the editors pick it up and assign the photojournalism aspect of it to our graphic design team , who adds the visual aspect to it .
The editors punch it up over the last couple of days and then it goes out over the Internet and into the print edition .
So you do n’t have writers coming up with a story and headline , but you will instead have a team of writers choosing the best headlines and then assign it to a particular writer who was not necessarily involved ?
Writers will occasionally write their own headlines , but we come up with a list of 15 or 20 headline ideas , what we think will make a good story and then we assign it based upon what people ’s writing strengths are .
We have some people who are great at politics ; some people we give all the war stuff to ; someone who is in charge of the Britney Spears story of the week — the entertainment stories .
The headlines

It seems like some publications , like AM New York , always have a Britney Spears story ;
is there anything similar with The Onion where they continually revisit a topic or person ?
No , not necessarily .
We are a little less reactionary .
We tend to target the zeitgeist more than anything .
We ’ll hit the mainstream media ’s portrayal of the entertainment world as much as we ’ll hit characters in the entertainment world .
We ’ll attack People Magazine ’s coverage of Britney as much as Britney .
In an interview with Terry Gross , Stephen Colbert said of his time at Second City that they had decided on not doing political humor and , in particular , hackneyed political humor such as Ted Kennedy drinking jokes .
They felt it was overdone , mean-spirited and not funny .
Do your writers have similar rules of thumb ?
We do n’t have any rules or known lines we wo n’t cross .
We have an understanding based upon having the same writers in the back room for years , and those writers training the new writers as they come in .
There is an understanding in the room .
If it makes the room laugh , it probably ends up in the paper .
One example is we ran an article a couple of years back that was , " No Jennifer Lopez News Today " .
That was our reaction to all of the J-Lo stuff .
We were n’t going to touch on her dress , or who she was dating .
Just the fact that those were the lead stories for so many days , in everything from US Weekly to Time Magazine .
I think it ’s important we have an original take on those things .
I think it ’s similar to what Colbert said to Terry Gross .
We do n’t want to just traffic in the same 24 hour news cycle .
There ’s a 24 hour comedy news cycle that exists on all the late night talk shows .
The Onion has a different creative process where we are not trying to hit everything in the 24 hours and on the same notes .
We want an original take .
If we choose to do something on J-Lo , it ’s going to be something like that , something less obvious .
When you are going through the headlines , is it just you guys sitting around trying to crack each other up ?
It ’s the least amount of fun possible .
Nah , I ’m kidding .
It ’s actually more businesslike than you ’d imagine .
It ’s very much like you are trying to make the room laugh , but the room has been a sort of captive audience for many many years now , so it takes a lot to make the room laugh .
The best analogy I ’ve heard is when Rob Siegel , former editor-in-chief , likened it to wine tasting .
It ’s this quiet experience where you are trying to soak in what the joke is , have we done anything like this , is it a unique take , what are other people doing .
It ’s sort of like , " Hmmm ... that ’s hilarious . That ’s really really funny " rather than people falling off their chairs .
It ’s more subdued than I think what most people would expect .
It ’s more analytical and clinical ?
Not all the time , but it ca n’t be a laugh a minute .
Yeah , what you see on Studio 60 and 30 Rock , those are scripted writers rooms .
Everything is funny there .
There 's a lot of unfunny jokes that are told in a back room , that 's why they stay and die in that back room and do n’t go out in The Onion .
If someone is continually telling unfunny jokes , do you eventually fire them ?
That ’s why we are on the 10th floor to make sure they die when they get kicked out .
It can be a real mess on Broadway .
By the time you get to be a writer for The Onion , though , the odds are you are going to succeed because we make it pretty challenging .
You go through quite a bit .
You will already have demonstrated a pretty long successful record of writing stuff for us before you will be in that room on a daily basis .
But if somebody wakes up one morning and suddenly no longer is funny , then yeah , head first , out the door as quickly as possible , and as sadistically as possible .
A bust of Patrick Gordon in Yekaterinburg , Russia
Patrick Leopold Gordon of Auchleuchries ( 31 March 1635 in Auchleuchries , Aberdeenshire , Scotland – 29 November 1699 in Moscow , Russia ) was a general and rear admiral in Russia , of Scottish origin .
He was descended from a family of Aberdeenshire , holders of the small estate of Auchleuchries , near Ellon .
The family was connected with the noble branch of Haddo .
As a result of his distinguished service for Sweden , Poland and Russia he rose in ranks from trooper to full general , and became principal advisor and close friend of Tsar Peter the Great .
Gordon assumed the additional Christian name of Leopold when confirmed as a Roman Catholic shortly before his death .
Life
Gordon was brought up and remained a lifelong Roman Catholic , at a time when the Church was being persecuted in Scotland , which had become Calvinist .
After an education at the parish schools of Cruden and Ellon , at age of fifteen he entered the Jesuit college at Braunsberg , East Prussia , then part of Poland ; however , his character did not tolerate well the strict and sombre way of life at the school , and he soon decided to return home .
He changed his mind , however , before re-embarking on the journey back to Scotland , and after journeying on foot in several parts of what is today Germany , in 1655 he enlisted at Hamburg into the military service of Sweden .
In the course of the next five years he served alternately for Poland and Sweden and was taken prisoner by both .
At the Battle of Chudnov in 1660 , Gordon was wounded . [ 1 ]
Upon hearing of the Stuart restoration , Gordon left the Polish service , but found himself unable to obtain military employment in Scotland or England . [ 1 ]
In 1661 , after further experiences as a soldier of fortune , he joined the Russian army under Tsar Aleksei I , and in 1665 was sent on a special mission to England .
After his return he distinguished himself in several wars against the Turks and Tatars in southern Russia .
Gordon disliked the Russian service , complaining of the corruption and venality of Russian officials , which left him , in his own words , " almost at wit s end with vexation " . [ 2 ]
However , in recognition of his service he was promoted to major-general in 1678 , was appointed to the high command at Kiev in 1679 , and in 1683 was made lieutenant-general .
He was not the only Scottish soldier in the Tsar 's service ; his fellow-Scots Paul Menzies and Alexander Livingston also found themselves in Russia fleeing religious intolerance or seeking adventure .
Gordon visited England and Scotland in 1686 .
In 1687 and 1689 he took part in expeditions against the Tatars in the Crimea , being made a full general .
Later in 1689 a revolution broke out in Moscow , and with the troops under his command Gordon virtually decided events in favour of Peter the Great , [ 3 ] and against the Regent , Tsarevna Sophia Alekseyevna .
Consequently , he was for the remainder of his life in high favour with the Tsar , who confided to him the command of his capital during his absence from Russia .
In 1696 , Gordon 's design of a " moveable rampart " played a key role in helping the Russians take Azov . [ 3 ]
Gordon 's alleged tomb at Vvedenskoye Cemetery in Moscow .
One of Gordon 's greatest achievements was securing permission from the Tsars to establish the first Roman Catholic church and school in Muscovy , of which he remained the main benefactor , and headed the Catholic community in Russia until his death .
For his services his second son James , brigadier of the Russian army , was created Count of the Holy Roman Empire in 1701 .
The Tsar employed him in organizing his army according to the West European system ; and raised him to the rank of full general .
At the end of his life the Tsar , who had visited Gordon frequently during his illness , was with him when he died , and with his own hands closed his eyes .
Originally buried in the Foreign Quarter , his remains were reinterred at Azov in 1877 , with an inscription in German which mistakenly gives his rank as Oberst , Colonel .
General Gordon left behind him a uniquely detailed diary of his life and times , written in English .
This is preserved in manuscript in the Russian State Military Archive in Moscow .
An incomplete and faulty German translation , edited by Dr Moritz Posselt ( Tagebuch des Generals Patrick Gordon ) was published , the first volume at Moscow in 1849 , the second at St Petersburg in 1851 , and the third at St Petersburg in 1853 ; and Passages from the Diary of General Patrick Gordon of Auchleuchries ( 1635 – 1699 ) , was printed , under the editorship of Joseph Robertson , for the Spalding Club , at Aberdeen , Scotland , 1859 .
A new full scholarly edition of Gordon 's Diary in English was published by the Centre for Irish and Scottish Studies in Aberdeen ( 6 vols , 2009 - 2016 ) , as well as its translation into Russian .
His daughter was married firstly to the German-Russian Colonel Rudolf Strasburgh , and then from 1699 or 1700 to his kinsman in the Russian service Alexander Gordon of Auchintoul , author of " The History of Peter the Great , Emperor of Russia " .
She lived until 1739 . [ 4 ]
Emperor Norton
Joshua Abraham Norton ( c. 1818 – January 8 , 1880 ) , known as Emperor Norton , was a citizen of San Francisco , California , who in 1859 proclaimed himself " Norton I , Emperor of the United States " .
He later expanded his pretense by claiming to be " Protector of Mexico " as well .
Born in England , Norton spent most of his early life in South Africa .
After the death of his mother in 1846 and his father in 1848 , he sailed west , arriving in San Francisco possibly in November 1849 .
Norton initially made a living as a businessman , but he lost his fortune investing in Peruvian rice .
After he lost a lawsuit in which he tried to void his rice contract , Norton 's public prominence faded .
He reemerged in September 1859 , laying claim to the position of Emperor of the United States .
He had no political power , and his influence extended only so far as he was humored by those around him ;
nevertheless , he was treated deferentially in San Francisco , and currency issued in his name was honored in the establishments he frequented .
Though some considered him insane or eccentric , citizens of San Francisco celebrated his regal presence and his proclamations , such as his order that the United States Congress be dissolved by force and his numerous decrees calling for a bridge connecting San Francisco to Oakland , and a corresponding tunnel to be built under San Francisco Bay .
Long after his death , similar structures were built in the form of the San Francisco – Oakland Bay Bridge and the Transbay Tube , and there have been campaigns to rename the bridge " The Emperor Norton Bridge " .
On January 8 , 1880 , Norton collapsed at the corner of California and Dupont ( now Grant ) streets and died before he could be given medical treatment .
Nearly 30,000 people packed the streets of San Francisco to pay him homage at his funeral .
Norton has been immortalized as the basis of characters in the literature of writers Mark Twain , Robert Louis Stevenson , Christopher Moore , Morris and Goscinny , Selma Lagerlöf , and Neil Gaiman .

Declares himself emperor
Emperor Joshua Norton , in full military regalia , circa 1880 or earlier
By 1859 , Norton had become completely disgruntled with what he considered the inadequacies of the legal and political structures of the United States .
On September 17 , 1859 , he took matters into his own hands and distributed letters to the various newspapers in the city , proclaiming himself " Emperor of these United States " :
At the peremptory request and desire of a large majority of the citizens of these United States , I , Joshua Norton , formerly of Algoa Bay , Cape of Good Hope , and now for the last 9 years and 10 months past of S.F. , Cal. , declare and proclaim myself Emperor of these U.S. ;
and in virtue of the authority thereby in me vested , do hereby order and direct the representatives of the different States of the Union to assemble in Musical Hall , of this city , on the 1st day of Feb. next , then and there to make such alterations in the existing laws of the Union as may ameliorate the evils under which the country is laboring , and thereby cause confidence to exist , both at home and abroad , in our stability and integrity .
— NORTON I , Emperor of the United States .
The announcement was first reprinted for humorous effect by the editor of the San Francisco Bulletin .
Norton would later add " Protector of Mexico " to this title .
Thus commenced his unprecedented and whimsical 21-year " reign " over America .
One of Norton 's undated proclamations
In his self-appointed role of emperor , Norton issued numerous decrees on matters of the state .
After assuming absolute control over the country , he saw no further need for a legislature , and on October 12 , 1859 , he issued a decree formally abolishing the United States Congress .
In it , Norton observed :
... fraud and corruption prevent a fair and proper expression of the public voice ;
that open violation of the laws are constantly occurring , caused by mobs , parties , factions and undue influence of political sects ;
that the citizen has not that protection of person and property which he is entitled .
Norton ordered all interested parties to assemble at Platt 's Music Hall in San Francisco in February 1860 to " remedy the evil complained of " .
In an imperial decree the following month , Norton summoned the Army to depose the elected officials of the U.S. Congress :
WHEREAS , a body of men calling themselves the National Congress are now in session in Washington City , in violation of our Imperial edict of the 12th of October last , declaring the said Congress abolished ;
WHEREAS , it is necessary for the repose of our Empire that the said decree should be strictly complied with ;
NOW , THEREFORE , we do hereby Order and Direct Major-General Scott , the Command-in-Chief of our Armies , immediately upon receipt of this , our Decree , to proceed with a suitable force and clear the Halls of Congress .

The thousands of cosplay outfits on parade around the various halls offered a tremendous cross-section of genres and eras of pop culture .
The majority of outfits involved at least some elements made from scratch , a fantastic display of craftsmanship .
Of the thousands , Wikinews spoke with a cosplayer going by the name " The Katherinator " .
She was outside the building in the gardens , waiting for a photographer she had arranged to shoot her new Epic Mickey costumed character-style outfit .
With shoes as wide as a forearm , and a rigid torso of carved foam , she remained exuberant even when caught in the traffic between halls , many hours into wearing the outfit .

Eugene Nida
Eugene A. Nida ( November 11 , 1914 – August 25 , 2011 ) was a linguist who developed the dynamic-equivalence Bible-translation theory and one of the founders of the modern discipline of Translation Studies .
Life
Nida was born in Oklahoma City , Oklahoma on November 11 , 1914 .
He became a Christian at a young age , when he responded to the altar call at his church " to accept Christ as my Saviour . "
He graduated summa cum laude from the University of California in 1936 .
After graduating he attended Camp Wycliffe , where Bible translation theory was taught .
He ministered for a short time among the Tarahumara Indians in Chihuahua , Mexico , until health problems due to an inadequate diet and the high altitude forced him to leave .
Sometime in this period , Nida became a founding charter member of Wycliffe Bible Translators , a related organization to the Summer Institute of Linguistics .
In 1937 , Nida undertook studies at the University of Southern California , where he obtained a master 's degree in New Testament Greek in 1939 .
In that same year he became interim pastor of Calvary Church of Santa Ana , California following the resignation of its founding pastor .
Despite his conservative background , in later years Nida became increasingly ecumenical and New Evangelical ( clarification needed ) in his approach .
In 1943 , Nida received his Ph.D. in Linguistics from the University of Michigan .
He was ordained as a Baptist minister .
He married Althea Lucille Sprague , who died in 1993 .
In 1997 , he married María Elena Fernandez-Miranda , a lawyer and diplomatic attache .
Nida retired in the early 1980s , although he continued to give lectures in universities all around the world , and lived in Alpine , Arizona , USA ; Madrid , Spain and Brussels , Belgium .
He died in Madrid on August 25 , 2011 aged 96 .
Theories
Nida has been a pioneer in the fields of translation theory and linguistics .
His Ph.D. dissertation , A Synopsis of English Syntax , was the first full-scale analysis of a major language according to the " immediate-constituent " theory .
His textbook Morphology : The Descriptive Analysis of Words was one of the major works of American Structuralism .
It remained the only thorough introduction to the field for decades and is still valuable for its many examples and exercises .
His most notable contribution to translation theory is Dynamic Equivalence , also known as Functional Equivalence .
For more information , see " Dynamic and formal equivalence . "
Nida also developed the componential analysis technique , which split words into their components to help determine equivalence in translation ( e.g. " bachelor " = male + unmarried ) .
This is , perhaps , not the best example of the technique , though it is the most well-known .
Nida 's dynamic-equivalence theory is often held in opposition to the views of philologists who maintain that an understanding of the source text ( ST ) can be achieved by assessing the inter-animation of words on the page , and that meaning is self-contained within the text ( i.e. much more focused on achieving semantic equivalence ) .
This theory , along with other theories of correspondence in translating , are elaborated in his essay Principles of Correspondence , where Nida begins by asserting that given that " no two languages are identical , either in the meanings given to corresponding symbols or in the ways in which symbols are arranged in phrases and sentences , it stands to reason that there can be no absolute correspondence between languages .
Hence , there can be no fully exact translations . "
While the impact of a translation may be close to the original , there can be no identity in detail .
Nida then sets forth the differences in translation , as he would account for it , within three basic factors :
The nature of the message :
in some messages the content is of primary consideration , and in others the form must be given a higher priority .
The purpose of the author and of the translator :
to give information on both form and content ;
to aim at full intelligibility of the reader so he / she may understand the full implications of the message ;
for imperative purposes that aim at not just understanding the translation but also at ensuring no misunderstanding of the translation .
The type of audience :
prospective audiences differ both in decoding ability and in potential interest .
Nida brings in the reminder that while there are no such things as " identical equivalents " in translating , what one must in translating seek to do is find the " closest natural equivalent " .
Here he identifies two basic orientations in translating based on two different types of equivalence :
Formal Equivalence ( F-E ) and Dynamic Equivalence ( D-E ) .
F-E focuses attention on the message itself , in both form and content .
Such translations then would be concerned with such correspondences as poetry to poetry , sentence to sentence , and concept to concept .
Such a formal orientation that typifies this type of structural equivalence is called a " gloss translation " in which the translator aims at reproducing as literally and meaningfully as possible the form and content of the original .
The principles governing an F-E translation would then be : reproduction of grammatical units ; consistency in word usage ; and meanings in terms of the source context .
North Korea puts military in ' quasi-state of war '
Friday , August 21 , 2015
According to Yonhap news agency , quoting North Korea 's main news agency Korean Central News Agency ( KCNA ) , the country 's military has been placed on high alert and has been told to prepare a " quasi-state of war " .
The report comes after North and South Korea exchanged artillery fire yesterday .
" War maniacs of the South Korean puppet military made another grave provocation to the DPRK in the central western sector of the front on Thursday afternoon .
They perpetrated such reckless action as firing 36 shells at KPA civil police posts under the absurd pretext that the KPA fired one shell at the south side .
Six shells of them hit the area near KPA civil police posts 542 and 543 and other 15 shells fell near KPA civil police posts 250 and 251 " , said KCNA .
" Foolhardy provocation deserves harsh punishment " , it added ; and , later , " Kim Jong-un issued an order of the supreme commander of the Korean People 's Army [ KPA ] that the front-line large combined units of the KPA should enter a wartime state to be fully battle ready to launch surprise operations " .
Yesterday , North Korea fired artillery rounds aimed at a loudspeaker in South Korea that broadcasts anti-Pyongyang propaganda into the North .
" Commanders of the Korean People 's Army were hastily dispatched to the front-line troops to command military operations to destroy psychological warfare tools if the enemy does not stop the propaganda broadcast within 48 hours and prepare against the enemy 's possible counteractions " , added KCNA .
No injuries or deaths were reported in the attacks from either side , but South Korea evacuated about 80 people in the town of Yeoncheon after at least one shell landed near the area .
The South retaliated by firing dozens of rounds of artillery into the north .
South Korea had recently started to broadcast propaganda from loudspeakers after an 11-year lull .
The broadcasts began on August 10 and South Korea says the broadcasts will continue .
After the exchange of fire , North Korea stated it would attack any loudspeakers broadcasting propaganda and would respond , militarily , within 48 hours if the broadcasts do not stop .
Both countries have put their militaries on high levels of alert .

wikiHow is a wiki-based site which aims to " build the world 's largest , highest quality how-to manual . "
It recently published its 50,000th article , and to discuss what the site has achieved since its creation , Wikinews interviewed the site 's founder , Jack Herrick .
In the interview , Herrick explains what wikiHow is , why he decided to create it , how he grew it in size , and why he chose to use a Creative Commons license ( HyperLink ) for his site .
Read below for more of the interview in full .
Interview
For our readers who are unaware of your site , could you briefly explain what wikiHow is ?
Sure .
wikiHow is a collaborative effort to build the world 's largest , highest quality how-to manual .
Our long term goal is to produce practical instructions on almost every topic in every language .
We 're quite far from our goals currently , but we take comfort in the fact that every month wikiHow gets noticeably better and larger
We currently have just under 50000 articles and over 1000 featured articles .
We hope that in time , we will have millions of articles with many of them having featured status .
That said , we are realistic enough to realize that this goal will take decades to achieve .
However , in terms of readership , we are probably the most popular single subject wiki after Wikipedia .
We get over 14 million unique visitors per month ( source : Google Analytics ) , which makes us the 135th most popular site according to Quantcast .
[ Note : The interview took place just before the 50000 milestone was met ]
Like Wikipedia , wikiHow is a wiki that runs on Mediawiki software .
Our community is full of volunteers from all over the world .
That said , we are quite different from Wikipedia in several respects :
We are much smaller .
The English wikiHow has only 60 admins , compared to the 1000 + on English Wikipedia .
As a result , wikiHow is still at the size that every editor eventually gets to know other editors .
We are run as a Hybrid Organization - a for-profit company focused on achieving a social good .
This has several advantages and disadvantages when compared to the non-profit structure at the Wikimedia Foundation .
We show opt-out advertising to anonymous visitors rather than ask for donations .
Our advertising revenue funds community meetups and has even allowed us to donate over $ 60,000 to charities such as the Wikimedia Foundation and Creative Commons .
( http://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Contributions-to-Charity ) .
In addition , we 've used our revenue on things like buying carbon offsets to become carbon neutral .
( http://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Carbon-Neutral )
Our community culture is focused on wikiLove and civility .
As a result some folks believe wikiHow is a more humane and enjoyable place to work than other places online .
Why did you decide to create wikiHow ?
I think that providing people with a practical education is one of the most empowering things you can offer a person .
Imagine having detailed step-by-step instructions on how to do any activity you could imagine .
How much more could you accomplish as an individual if you could learn any activity ?
I think that building a universal how-to manual would be a tremendous gift for the world .
Knowledge is power and wikiHow has the potential to make all of us a bit more powerful .
I 've been interested in building a comprehensive how-to manual long before I first envisioned wikiHow .
My first attempt at building this resource was a website I used to run called eHow .
eHow was and continues to be the largest and how to website in the world .
eHow contains copyrighted content run on proprietary software .
When I ran eHow , the content was professionally produced and edited .
This business model worked for producing content on topics that appeal to advertisers in languages like English that have large advertising markets .
However , paying people to write and edit articles ultimately means that you have to make one of two sacrifices .
You either 1 ) sacrifice on breadth and do n't produce the topics that wo n't interest advertisers , or 2 ) you sacrifice on quality and produce content that does n't cost much to write .
I was n't interested in making either of these sacrifices , as I think the world 's how to manual needs to be high quality AND comprehensive .
So ultimately I decided that eHow 's model would not build the resource I envisioned .
When I discovered Wikipedia , I recognized that the wiki model had the potential to build the how-to resource the world really needs .
So I decided to sell eHow and use the proceeds to build wikiHow .
Why did you decide to use a Creative Commons license ?
We use a Creative Commons license to give our community the right to fork ( http://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Right-to-Fork ) .
In my opinion , people should be hesitant to contribute to websites where you only have the " right to leave . "
If wikiHow volunteers think our site is going in the wrong direction , they can take all the content and all the software and move the project elsewhere .
This is possible because we release all of our software under the Open Source GPL license and release our content under a Creative Commons license .
This right to fork guarantees that wikiHow , the company , will always serve the goal of the mission and our volunteer community .
I believe that offering this right to fork has been a key element of our success thus far .
My hope is that over time , internet users will demand this of any site where they invest their time in a way that creates value for others .
That said , when we started out I did n't know the difference between the GNU Free Document License and my California Driver 's license .
As a result , we made some mistakes along the path .
In retrospect , I think we probably should have selected the CC BY-SA license instead of CC-BY-SA-NC .
At a minimum this would provide a helpful compatibility with other wikis and free culture projects .
wikiHow now has millions of visitors per month .
How did you grow the site to the size it is today ?
In December 2008 , wikiHow had over 14 million unique visitors according to Google Analytics ( Full data : http://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Statistics ) .
Quantcast ranks wikiHow as the 135th most popular site in the US .
( http://www.quantcast.com/wikihow.com ) .
wikiHow achieved this popularity for a few reasons .
First , people around the world are desperate for high quality how-to information .
People want to learn more practical skills , and for the most part the internet does n't provide enough quality information yet .
Second , we attracted millions of readers via the virtuous circle of wiki editing : We had some articles of mixed quality , and editors joined to improve those articles , which in turn attracted more readers .
We continue to depend on this same virtuous cycle : More readers , means more editors , which creates better instructions , leading again to more readers .
It is the same virtuous circle that Wikipedia has enjoyed .
NASA celebrates 30th anniversary of first shuttle launch ; announces new homes for retired shuttles
Wednesday , April 13 , 2011
NASA Administrator Charles Bolden announces where four space shuttle orbiters will be permanently displayed at the conclusion of the Space Shuttle Program during an event commemorating the 30th anniversay of the first shuttle launch on April 12 , 2011 .

NASA celebrated the launch of the first space shuttle Tuesday at an event at the Kennedy Space Center ( KSC ) in Cape Canaveral , Florida .
On April 12 , 1981 , Space Shuttle Columbia lifted off from the Kennedy Space Center on STS-1 , the first space shuttle mission .
NASA held a ceremony commemorating the date outside the hangar , known as Orbiter Processing Facility-1 , for Space Shuttle Atlantis , which is being prepped for its final mission which will be STS-135 , which will be the last Space Shuttle mission .
At the ceremony , NASA Administrator Charles Bolden announced the locations that would be given the three remaining Space Shuttle orbiters following the end of the Space Shuttle program .
The prototype orbiter , Space Shuttle Enterprise would be relocated from the Smithsonian 's National Air and Space Museum Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center at Washington Dulles International Airport to the Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum in New York City .
Space Shuttle Discovery will take the place of Enterprise at the Udvar-Hazy Center .
Discovery has already been retired following the completion of STS-133 last month , its 39th mission .
Discovery is undergoing decommissioning and currently being prepped for display by removing toxic materials from the orbiter .
Looking back : Space Shuttle Columbia lifts off on STS-1 from Launch Pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center on April 12 , 1981 .

Space Shuttle Endeavour , which will launch on STS-134 at the end of the month on April 29 , will be sent to the California Science Center in Los Angeles , California following its retirement .
Finally , Atlantis will go on display at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex following the orbiter 's last flight which launches June 28 .
Columbia was lost tragically back on February 1 , 2003 when it disintegrated during re-entry killing all seven astronauts aboard .
Space Shuttle Challenger was lost when it exploded 73 seconds after liftoff back on January 28 , 1986 killing all six aboard .
" We want to thank all of the locations that expressed an interest in one of these national treasures , " said Bolden to the gathered crowd which contained many KSC employees .
" This was a very difficult decision , but one that was made with the American public in mind .
In the end , these choices provide the greatest number of people with the best opportunity to share in the history and accomplishments of NASA 's remarkable Space Shuttle Program .
These facilities we 've chosen have a noteworthy legacy of preserving space artifacts and providing outstanding access to U.S. and international visitors . "

Not all were pleased with the final choice of locations .
U.S. Senator John Cornyn , Republican from Texas , issued a statement regarding the rejection of Johnson Space Center ( JSC ) in Houston , Texas as a location .
" Like many Texans , I am disappointed with NASA 's decision to slight the Johnson Space Center as a permanent home for one of the Space Shuttle Orbiters .
Houston has played a critical role throughout the life of the space shuttle , but it is clear political favors trumped common sense and fairness in the selection of the final locations for the orbiter fleet . "
Cornyn 's statement added , " There is no question Houston should have been selected as a final home for one of the orbiters — even Administrator Bolden stated as much .
Today 's announcement is an affront to the thousands of dedicated men and women at Johnson Space Center , the greater Houston community and the State of Texas , and I m deeply disappointed with the Administration 's misguided decision . “
However , the JSC will recieve pilot and commander seats from the flight deck .
The Museum of Flight in Seattle , Washington was also proposed as another location for a shuttle , going so far as to build a new building to house an orbiter .
In a statement , Governor of Washington Chris Gregoire said , " The Museum of Flight put a tremendous amount of effort into landing a retired shuttle in the Pacific Northwest .
As the home of modern day air travel and the 747 , which has gracefully transported shuttles for the last 30 years , Seattle would have been a perfect fit .
While the Museum of Flight was in the top running , I m disappointed that NASA did not choose them .
In 2008 , Endeavour and Atlantis await a journey on their respective launchpads .

" However , the full fuselage trainer , that every astronaut including [ former Museum of Flight CEO ] Bonnie Dunbar has been trained on , will soon call the Museum of Flight home .
The largest of the trainers , this addition will allow visitors to actually climb aboard the trainer and experience the hands-on training that astronauts get .
Visitors will not be allowed in the other shuttles and this trainer is a true win for our dynamic museum .
It will help inspire young people to the adventure of space and to the excitement of a career in science , technology , engineering and math . "
Today 's announcement is an affront to the thousands of dedicated men and women at Johnson Space Center , the greater Houston community and the State of Texas , and I m deeply disappointed with the Administration 's misguided decision .
John Cornyn , U.S. Senator ( R-Texas )
Other items include various shuttle simulators which will be given to the Adler Planetarium in Chicago , Illinois , the Evergreen Aviation & Space Museum of McMinnville , Oregon , and Texas A&M 's Aerospace Engineering Department .
The nose cap assembly and crew compartment trainer for the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio and orbital maneuvering system engines for the U.S. Space and Rocket Center in Huntsville , Alabama , the National Air and Space Museum , and the Evergreen Aviation & Space Museum .
NASA is also offering shuttle heat shield tiles to schools and universities that want to share technology and a piece of space history with their students .
The 30th anniversary of the first shuttle mission coincided with the 50th anniversary of the first manned space flight when Yuri Gagarin lifted off aboard Vostok 1 into space .
Coron
Coron is in the province of Palawan , Philippines on Busuanga Island .
It is the largest town on the island and has the largest share of accommodations .
Background
Coron is both the name of the largest town on the island of Busuanga , and the name of a different , smaller island just offshore .
The area is famous for its World War II wreck diving , and the site has been named in many lists of top dive spots in the world .
In September 1944 , a fleet of Japanese ships hiding in the harbor were sunk in a daring raid by the US navy .
The result is around ten well preserved underwater shipwrecks surrounded with coral reef .
There are also attractions on Coron Island itself .
There are many beautiful white sand beaches , mostly tiny and surrounded by large limestone cliffs and wildlife .
Barracuda and Kayangan lakes are both stunning locations , and good for snorkeling , and the island is the ancestral domain of an indigenous tribe who are managing the island in a sustainable way and keeping outsiders at a distance and offshore at night .
History
The first inhabitants of Coron were the Tagbanuas who belong to the second wave of Indonesians who migrated to this area some 5,000 years ago .
They were a nomadic , seafaring people , living mainly by fishing and subsistence agriculture .
Although they are now sedentary ( with the young using cell phones , etc. ) , they maintain many of their old customs , traditions and beliefs .
Today , the Tagbanuas remain the dominant if not entire population of Coron .
In 1902 that Coron was registered as a town and the name of the town was officially changed from Penon de Coron to Coron .
From 1939 to the outbreak of World War II , the municipality experienced the mining boom .
Labor shifted from farming to mining .
In July 1942 the Japanese occupied the mining camps and resumed operation of the manganese mines .
On September 24 , 1944 , a group of Japanese ships were sunk by American warplanes in Coron waters as the ships retreated from Manila Bay .
To this day , about 10 or 12 of these World War II Japanese shipwrecks comprise what is considered one of the best dive sites in the world .
In 1947 , large scale deep sea fishing was introduced to Coron , and the town experienced another boom , a fishing boom .
The population increased , as many people from Luzon and the Visayas came to work either as fishermen or miners .
On June 17 , 1950 , Busuanga was officially created as a separate municipality from Coron and in 1954 , Coron was further reduced by the official creation of the Municipality of Linapacan .
On September 12 , 1992 , Coron was finally reduced by the official creation of the Municipality of Culion .
In the past , Coron was virtually unknown outside of Palawan .
It remains a small , quaint fishing town with laid back charm but with increasing media exposure it is growing , slowly but steadily ,
Coron has taken an important position in the tourism industry .
In the past decade , there has been a rapid influx of scuba divers and other tourists coming in , making tourism the major industry player in Coron today .
Antonín Dvořák
Antonín Leopold Dvořák ( / d(ə)ˈvɔːrʒɑːk , -ʒæk / d(ə)-VOR-zha(h)k ; Czech : [ ˈantoɲiːn ˈlɛopolt ˈdvor̝aːk ] ; 8 September 1841 – 1 May 1904 ) was a Czech composer .
After Bedřich Smetana , he was the next Czech Romantic-era composer to achieve worldwide recognition .
Following Smetana 's nationalist example , Dvořák frequently employed aspects , specifically rhythms , of the folk music of Moravia and his native Bohemia .
Dvořák 's own style has been described as " the fullest recreation of a national idiom with that of the symphonic tradition , absorbing folk influences and finding effective ways of using them " . [ 1 ]
Antonín Dvořák
Dvořák displayed his musical gifts at an early age , being an apt violin student from age six .
The first public performances of his works were in Prague in 1872 and , with special success , in 1873 , when he was aged 31 .
Seeking recognition beyond the Prague area , he submitted a score of his First Symphony to a prize competition in Germany , but did not win , and the unreturned manuscript was lost until rediscovered many decades later .
In 1874 he made a submission to the Austrian State Prize for Composition , including scores of two further symphonies and other works .
Although Dvořák was not aware of it , Johannes Brahms was the leading member of the jury and was highly impressed .
The prize was awarded to Dvořák in 1874 [ a ] and again in 1876 and in 1877 , when Brahms and the prominent critic Eduard Hanslick , also a member of the jury , made themselves known to him .
Brahms recommended Dvořák to his publisher , Simrock , who soon afterward commissioned what became the Slavonic Dances , Op. 46 .
These were highly praised by the Berlin music critic Louis Ehlert in 1878 , the sheet music ( of the original piano 4-hands version ) had excellent sales , and Dvořák 's international reputation was launched at last .
Dvořák 's first piece of a religious nature , his setting of Stabat Mater , was premiered in Prague in 1880 .
It was very successfully performed in London in 1883 , leading to many other performances in the United Kingdom and United States . [ 2 ]
In his career , Dvořák made nine invited visits to England , often conducting performances of his own works .
His Seventh Symphony was written for London .
Visiting Russia in March 1890 , he conducted concerts of his own music in Moscow and Saint Petersburg . [ 3 ]
In 1891 Dvořák was appointed as a professor at the Prague Conservatory .
In 1890 – 91 , he wrote his Dumky Trio , one of his most successful chamber music pieces .
In 1892 , Dvořák moved to the United States and became the director of the National Conservatory of Music of America in New York City .
While in the United States , Dvořák wrote his two most successful orchestral works : the Symphony From the New World , which spread his reputation worldwide , [ 4 ] and his Cello Concerto , one of the most highly regarded of all cello concerti .
He also wrote his most appreciated piece of chamber music , the American String Quartet , during this time .
But shortfalls in payment of his salary , along with increasing recognition in Europe and an onset of homesickness , led him to leave the United States and return to Bohemia in 1895 .
All of Dvořák 's nine operas but his first have librettos in Czech and were intended to convey Czech national spirit , as were some of his choral works .
By far the most successful of the operas is Rusalka .
Among his smaller works , the seventh Humoresque and the song " Songs My Mother Taught Me " are also widely performed and recorded .
He has been described as " arguably the most versatile ... composer of his time " . [ 5 ]
Cold as ice : Wikinews interviews Marymegan Daly on unusual new sea anemone
Tuesday , January 21 , 2014
How did you come to be involved with this discovery
Frank Rack got in touch after they returned from Antarctica in hopes that I could help with an identification on the anemone .
What was your first reaction upon learning there was an undiscovered ecosystem under the ice in the Ross Sea ?
I was amazed and really excited .
I think to say it was unexpected is inaccurate , because it implies that there was a well-founded expectation of something .
The technology that Frank and his colleagues are using to explore the ice is so important because , given our lack of data , we have no reasonable expectation of what it should be like , or what it should n't be like .
There 's a return trip planned hopefully for 2015 , with both biologists and ANDRILL geologists .
Are you intending to go there yourself ?
I would love to .
But I am also happy to not go , as long as someone collects more animals on my behalf !
What I want to do with the animals requires new material preserved in diverse ways , but it does n't require me to be there .
Although I am sure that being there would enhance my understanding of the animals and the system in which they live , and would help me formulate more and better questions about the anemones , ship time is expensive , especially in Antarctica , and if there are biologists whose contribution is predicated on being there , they should have priority to be there .
These animals are shrouded in mystery .
Some of the most intriguing questions are chemical ; do they produce some kind of antifreeze , and is that orange glow in the ROV lights their own ?
Talk us through the difficulties encountered when trying to find answers with the specimens on hand .
The samples we have are small in terms of numbers and they are all preserved in formalin ( a kind of formaldehyde solution ) .
The formalin is great for preserving structures , but for anemones , it prevents study of DNA or of the chemistry of the body .
This means we ca n't look at the issue you raise with these animals .
What we could do , however , was to study anatomy and figure out what it is , so that when we have samples preserved for studying e.g. , the genome , transcriptome , or metabolome , or conduct tests of the fluid in the burrows or in the animals themselves , we can make precise comparisons , and figure out what these animals have or do ( metabolically or chemically ) that lets them live where they live .
Just knowing a whole lot about a single species is n't very useful , even if that animal is as special as these clearly are -
we need to know what about them is different and thus related to living in this strange way .
The only way to get at what 's different is to make comparisons with close relatives .
We can start that side of the work now , anticipating having more beasts in the future .
In terms of their glow , I suspect that it 's not theirs -
although luminescence is common in anemone relatives , they do n't usually make light themselves .
They do make a host of florescent proteins , and these may interact with the light of the ROV to give that gorgeous glow .
What analysis did you perform on the specimens and what equipment was used ?
I used a dissecting scope to look at the animal 's external anatomy and overall body organization ( magnification of 60 X ) .
I embedded a few of the animals in wax and then cut them into very thin slices using a microtome , mounted the slices on microscope slides , stained the slices to enhance contrast , and then looked at those slides under a compound microscope
( that 's how I got the pictures of the muscles etc in the paper ) .
I used that same compound scope to look at squashed bits of tissue to see the stinging capsules ( = nematocysts ) .
I compared the things I saw under the 'scopes to what had been published on other species in this group .
This step seems trivial , but it is really the most important part !
By comparing my observations to what my colleagues and predecessors had found , I figured out what group it belongs to , and was able to determine that within that group , it was a new species .
It was three years between recovery of specimens and final publication , why did it take so long ?
You mean , how did we manage to make it all happen so quickly , right ? :)
It was about two years from when Frank sent me specimens to when we got the paper out .
Some of that time was just lost time -
I had other projects in the queue that I needed to finish .
Once we figured out what it was , we played a lot of manuscript email tag , which can be challenging and time consuming given the differing schedules that folks keep in terms of travel , field work , etc.
Manuscript review and processing took about four months .
What sort of difficulties were posed by the unorthodox preservatives used , and what additional work might be possible on a specimen with intact DNA ?
The preservation was not unorthodox -
they followed best practices for anatomical preservation .
Having DNA-suitable material will let us see whether there are new genes , or genes turned on in different ways and at different times that help explain how these animals burrow into hard ice and then survive in the cold .
I am curious about the population structure of the " fields " of anemones -
the group to which Edwardsiella andrillae belongs includes many species that reproduce asexually , and it 's possible that the fields are " clones " produced asexually rather than the result of sexual reproduction .
DNA is the only way to test this .
This map shows the location of the Ross Ice Shelf in the Antarctic , and the two known localities for E. andrillae relative to McMurdo Station

Daly explained how she obtained these images of the anemone 's anatomy .

Respect
Thais are a polite people and , while remarkably tolerant of foreigners gallivanting on their beaches and with their women , you ll find that you will get more respect if you in turn treat them and their customs with respect .
The wai
Ronald McDonald showing how it 's done
The traditional greeting known as the wai , where you press your hands together as is in prayer and bow slightly , is derived from the Hindu cultural influence from India , and still widely practised .
Among Thais , there are strict rules of hierarchy that dictate how and when the wai should be given .
In brief , inferiors salute superiors first .
You should not wai service people or street vendors .
The higher your hands go , the more respectful you are .
You will also often see Thais doing a wai as they walk past temples and spirit houses .
As a foreign visitor , you are not expected to know how to wai , nor to reciprocate when wai'd to ;
while you 're unlikely to cause offense if you do , you may well look slightly strange .
If somebody makes a wai to you , a slight bow alone is more than sufficient for ordinary occasions , and for business , most Thais will shake hands with foreigners instead of waiing anyway .
Dress
Personal appearance is very important in Thailand as a measure of respect to other people .
You will find that dressing appropriately means that you are shown more respect in return .
This translates in many ways , even sometimes lowering initial offering prices at markets .
While some allowance is made for the differing customs of foreigners , Thais respond more positively to well-dressed Westerners .
Traditionally , Thais are modest and conservative dressers .
At a minimum your clothes should be neat , clean , and free from holes or tears .
Except at the beach or at sacred sites normal western dress is acceptable for both men and women , except that you should avoid clothing showing a lot of skin .
Pants are preferable to shorts , blouses should have capped sleeves , and if tank tops are worn , the straps should be thick ( i.e. , not spaghetti straps ) .
Thai men generally wear pants , and most Thais view an adult man wearing shorts as fairly ridiculous ;
shorts are primarily worn by laborers and schoolchildren .
Men 's shorts should be knee length or more , if worn at all .
Taking off one 's shoes at temples and private homes is mandatory etiquette , and this may even be requested at some shops .
Wear shoes that slip on and off easily .
Flip-flops , hiking sandals , and clog-type shoes are usually a good pragmatic choice for traveling in Thailand ;
only in the most top-end establishments are shoes required .
It is best to play it safe with wats and other sacred sites in Thailand ;
your dress should be unambiguously modest and cover your entire torso and most of your limbs .
For men , ankle-length pants are mandatory ;
on top , t-shirts are acceptable , though a button-front or polo shirt would be best .
Many recommend that women wear only full length dresses and skirts ;
you should make sure that your clothing covers at least your shoulders and your knees and some places may require that you wear ankle-length pants or skirts and long sleeved tops .
Shorts and sleeveless shirts are highly inappropriate , as are short skirts .
The rules are even more strict for foreign visitors , so even if you see a local in shorts it 's not OK for everyone .
Topless sunbathing is common by Western women at many tourist beaches .
At beaches which are primarily Thai visitors however , this is not advised .
Religion
Buddhist prayer flags , Wat Arun , Bangkok
Monks are an integral part of Buddhism in Thailand , and Thai men are generally expected to spend a certain amount of time living as a monk at least once in their lifetime .
Buddhist monks are meant to avoid sexual temptations , and in particular they do not touch women or take things from women 's hands .
Women should make every effort to make way for monks on the street and give them room so they do not have to make contact with you .
Women should avoid offering anything to a monk with their hands .
Objects or donations should be placed in front of a monk so he can pick it up , or place it on a special cloth he carries with him .
Monks will sometimes be aided by a layman who will accept things from women merit-makers on their behalf .
Theravada Buddhist monks are also supposed to avoid material temptations and as such , are not allowed to touch money , so offering money to a monk is considered to be a sign of disrespect in most Theravada Buddhist cultures .
Therefore , should you wish to donate to a monk , you should only offer food , and put your monetary donation in the appropriate donation box at the temple .
Those monks that accept money are almost always fakes .
The Cost to Be Wise
Veronique stayed with me that night , lying next to me in my blankets and furs .
She did n't sleep , I do n't think .
I was listening to her breath .
I felt as if I should help her sleep .
I lay there and tried to think if I should put my arm around her , but I did n't know .
Maybe she did n't want to be touched .
And she had been a stupid girl , anyway .
She lay tense in the dark .
" Are you going to be a teacher ? " I asked .
She laughed .
" If I get out of here . "
I waited for her to say more , but she did n't .
" Get out of here " meant to make someone leave .
Maybe she meant if she made herself .
" You come here from Earth ? " I asked .
To get her to talk , although I was tired of lingua and I did n't really want to think about anything .
" My family came here from Earth , " she said .
" Why ? "
" My father , he 's an anthropologist , " she said .
" Do you know anthropologist ? "
" No , " I said .
" He is a person who studies the way people live .
And he is a teacher . "
All the offworlders I had ever met were teachers .
I wondered who did all the work on Earth .
" Because Earth had lost touch with your world , the people here are very interesting to my father , " she said .
Her voice was listless in the dark and she was even harder to understand when I could n't see her properly .
I did n't understand so I did n't say anything .
I was sorry I 'd started her talking .
" History , do you know the word ' history ' ? " she asked .
Of course I knew the word " history . "
" I study history in school , " I said .
Anneal and Kumar taught it .
" Do you know the history of this world ? "
It took my tired head a long time to sort that out .
" Yes , " I said .
" We are a colony .
People from Earth come here to live .
Then there is a big problem on Earth , and the people of Earth forget we are here .
We forget we are from Earth .
Then Earth finds us again . "
" Some people have stories about coming from the Earth , " Veronique said .
" My father is collecting those stories from different peoples .
I 'm a graduate student . "
The clans did n't have any stories about coming from Earth .
We said the first people came out of the sun .
This somehow seemed embarrassing .
I did n't understand what kind of student she was .
" Are you here for stories ? " I asked .
" No , " she said .
" Ian is old friends with your teacher , from back when they were both with the survey .
We just came to visit . "
I did n't understand what she 'd said except that they were visiting .
We were quiet after that .
I pretended to sleep .
Sometimes there was gunfire outside and we jumped , even Mam on the bed .
Everyone but Bet .
Once Bet was asleep it was impossible to wake her up .
I fell asleep thinking about how I wished that the Scathalos outrunners were gone .
I dreamed that I was at the offworlder 's home , where it was summer but no one was taking care of the stabros , and they were all glad , and so I was a hero - and I was startled awake by gunfire .
Just more drinking and shooting .
I wished my da would come home .
It did n't seem fair that we should lie here and be afraid while the men were getting drunk and singing .
Replication in Second Language Research :
Narrative and Systematic Reviews and Recommendations for the Field
Replication studies are considered by many to play a fundamental role in any scientific endeavor .
When using the same materials and procedures as a previous study , replication studies serve to test the reliability of the previous study ’s findings .
When altering specific methodological or participant characteristics of a previous study , they serve to test generalizability of the earlier findings under different conditions .
One indication of the importance of replication is found in the 50 or more calls for replication research in the field of second language ( L2 ) research alone ( see references for 50 calls and commentaries in Appendix S1 in the Supporting Information online ) : from Santos ( 1989 ) through Polio and Gass 1997 to very recent proposals for specific replication studies , such as Vandergrift and Cross 2017 and even a book-length treatment ( Porte , 2012 ) .
Beyond these calls , efforts to actively promote and facilitate replication studies have also emerged .
For example , the Instruments for Research into Second Languages ( IRIS ) repository ( http://www.irisdatabase.org ) was established in 2011 and holds , at the time of writing , over 3,800 materials that can be used for replication , among other purposes , in L2 research ( Marsden & Mackey , 2014 ; Marsden , Mackey , & Plonsky , 2016 ) .
The Open Science Framework ( https://osf.io ) , also established in 2011 , provides a web infrastructure to facilitate collaboration and has been used for large replication efforts in psychology ( e.g. , Open Science Collaboration , 2015 ) , which continue to make waves in academia ( Laws , 2016 ; Lindsay , 2015 ; Martin & Clarke , 2017 ) and the general media ( Baker , 2015 ; Devlin , 2016 ) .
In some fields , a flourishing metascience , that is , the scientific study of science ( see Munafò et al. , 2017 ) , has included syntheses assessing the quantity and nature of replication efforts , for example , in education ( Makel & Plucker , 2014 and in psychology ( Makel et al. , 2012 ) .
The driving force behind this battery of calls , commentaries , infrastructure , and metascience is a perceived crisis in the state of replication research .
The severe concerns underpinning the alleged crisis have several dimensions relating to : (a) the ( small ) amount of published replication research ; (b) the ( poor ) quality of replication research ; and (c) the ( lack of ) reproducibility , which refers to the extent to which findings can ( not ) be reproduced in replication attempts that have been undertaken .
These concerns speak to the very core of science , raising fundamental questions about the validity and reliability of our work .
Indeed , some commentators have called replication the “ gold standard ” of research evidence ( Jasny , Chin , Chong , & Vignieri , 2011 , p. 1225 ) and a “ linchpin of the scientific process ” ( Let ’s replicate , 2006 , p. 330 ) .
In the field of L2 research , given the importance of replication and the 50 calls for replication in L2 research that we identified , one might expect a substantial number of published replication studies by now .
However , a perceived lack of prestige , excitement , and originality of replication plagues L2 research ( Porte , 2012 ) , as it does other disciplines ( Berez-Kroeker et al. , 2017 ; Branco , Cohen , Vossen , Ide , & Calzolari , 2017 ; Chambers , 2017 ; Schmidt , 2009 ) , and these perceptions are thought to have caused , at least in part ( directly or indirectly ) , alleged low rates and a poor quality of published replication studies .
However , a systematic metascience on replication research has not yet been established in the field of L2 research , leaving a poor understanding of the actual number and nature of replication studies that have been published .
The current study begins to address this gap through narrative and systematic reviews .
The narrative review considers challenges in replication research and is largely informed by commentaries and metascience from psychology , given that the cognitive and social subdomains of psychology are highly influential in L2 research , and also from education , another key sister discipline .
The narrative review is organized around four broad themes : (a) the quantity of replication research , (b) the nature of replication research , (c) the relationship between initial and replication studies , and (d) the interpretation and extent of reproducibility of the findings of initial studies .
To gain insight into these issues in the context of L2 research , the systematic review provides a synthesis of L2 studies in journal articles that self-labeled as replications .
The research questions and methods of the systematic review were largely determined by the narrative review but also emerged through the design and piloting of the coding instrument .
Finally , we offer further discussion and 16 recommendations for future replication work that draw on our narrative and systematic reviews and on our experience of carrying out multisite ( Morgan-Short et al. , 2018 ) 1 and single site ( Faretta-Stutenberg & Morgan-Short , 2011 ; Marsden , Williams , & Liu , 2013 ; McManus & Marsden , 2017 ; Morgan-Short , Heil , Botero-Moriaty , & Ebert , 2012 ) replications .
We start from the widely agreed premise that testing the reproducibility of findings should have an essential role in the testing and refinement of theory , at least for hypothesis-testing epistemologies that seek to ascertain generalizability and for other epistemologies in which constructs are deemed to be definable and observable .
Thus , our overall aim is to provide conceptual clarification and an empirical base for future discussion and production of replication studies , with a view to improving the amount and quality of L2 replication research .
BDSM as business : An interview with the owners of a dungeon
Sunday , October 21 , 2007
Operating the business
The costs
Clothing supply closet .
There 's a misconception in this industry .
Your exposure to this is probably primarily what you see in movies , scanning magazines , scanning the Internet , just snippets everywhere .
It 's portrayed as though it 's dark , black and evil .
And --
Oh man , well ?
What 's up ?
I do wear a lot of black .
It 's anything but that .
If you look at the rooms , there 's all the accouterments you 'd find in these types of places --
but more than anything , there 's a lot of good feeling around here .
We hire the opposite of what you 'd think we would hire , what the average person would think we would hire .
We hire educated , nice people .
I remember one of our ads that I had put in said , " If you think nice girls do n't do S&M , " -- I forgot what the rest of it said --
" -- think again . "
Yeah , " think again " or something like that .
And that ad had pulled so many girls , because they -- I think they all thought that nice girls do n't do this .
And a bunch of them had called and they said , " Wow . "
And I think I remember , a bunch of guys called because of that also .
Do you remember ?
I sure do , I sure do .
What are the startup costs involved ?
It varies ; look around Manhattan , look around rents , look around build-outs , look around hiring , look around advertising ...
What 's your greatest non-fixed cost ?
The single most costly thing we spend on is rent and advertising , those two together make up the bulk of what we spend .
There 's supplies , and there 's wear and tear and maintenance , and bookkeeping and things like that that you have to do .
That 's about it .
The hardest thing in running this business , which is why people ca n't do it , is the relationship that my wife has with the gals and with the customers .
Where do you advertise ?
A lot on the web , we 've used most of the local city papers , New York Press , things like that , L Magazine .
In the back of the paper ?
Typically in the back of the paper .
Magazines constantly change their policy on it ; they want it , they do n't want it ...
Depending on the election year --
Who 's buying the paper , who 's selling the paper .
So it changes , so one year we got to be in the Press , but they have now stopped adult ads .
Completely .
So now we 'll be in the Voice for a while .
We 're moving more towards the Internet at this point , because the Internet is a much easier , safer way for a person to look at sensitive material and not get caught with it .
Hiring employees
Personality test questions given to prospective mistresses .
Pursuant to your business question : we only hire nice people .
I do n't care if a girl is absolutely exquisite looking --
My husband has met beautiful , beautiful girls --
-- beautiful girls --
-- and he 's in the end , he would say , " Well , I wo n't hire them . "
I 'm like , ‘ Are you insane ?
I wo n't hire them . I hire --
Why not ?
Because I want someone who 's going to treat people nicely and well .
We have --
How can you tell whether they will or will not ?
Just by talking to them ?
Having been a psychologist for a number of years gives me a leg up on it .
And he 's been right .
And I have made him hire these girls , and ultimately he 's been right
They 've been complete pain in the asses !
I also have a profile they fill out for me , a mini-MMPI that I developed , so that I have an idea -- Rebecca and I put it together
I do n't know if you 'd like to see one .
No , no , no . Just --
I could show you .
So I have a mini-MMPI that I --
Could I have a sample , not necessarily one that 's filled out , but just one that you --
I 'll show you .
The questions are --
Be careful .
He 'll make you fill one out .
You 'd be scared .
You would n't hire me .
Is it only girls you hire ?
Yeah .
What would a question like " the greatest woman in the world " reveal to you ?
No question would reveal anything independently of all the questions together --
Sure .
-- but I have a chart that I 'll go through ; the MMPI .
The baseline data that I use to --
How did you originate these questions ?
Where did I make them ?
You get a baseline from asking girls and refining profiles --
And it 's an amalgamation of questions .
Of many , many questions --
What 's your favorite question ?
I do n't know , the O.J. Simpson ….
Yeah , I see O.J. Simpson .
What would that be an indicator of ?
I 'm not sure which one you gave him , but there 's a brief , brief , brief IQ test there .
Very brief .
Do you ask for references ?
No , because I really ca n't call and tell them I 'm yeah , so-and-so 's applying here for a position .
Aesthetic Appreciation and Spanish Art :
Insights from Eye-Tracking

How do people look at and experience art ?
Which elements of specific artworks do they focus on ?
Do museum labels have an impact on how people look at artworks ?
The viewing experience of art is a complex one , involving issues of perception , attention , memory , decision-making , affect , and emotion .
Thus , the time it takes and the ways of visually exploring an artwork can inform about its relevance , interestingness , and even its aesthetic appeal .
This paper describes a collaborative pilot project focusing on a unique collection of 17th Century Zurbarán paintings .
The Jacob cycle at Auckland Castle is the only UK example of a continental collection preserved in situ in purpose-built surroundings .
While studies of the psychology of art have focused on individual works and distinctions between representative / non-representative topics , no work has been completed on the aesthetic appreciation of collections or of devotional themes .
In this paper , we report upon the novel insights eye-tracking techniques have provided into the unconscious processes of viewing the unique collection of Zurbarán artworks .
The purpose of this pilot study was to assess the effects of different written interpretation on the visual exploration of artworks .
We will discuss the potential implications of these techniques and our understanding of visual behaviours on museum and gallery practice .
The project brings together established research strengths in Spanish art history , experimental psychology , digital humanities , and museum studies to explore , using eye-tracking techniques , aesthetic reactions to digital representations of the individual Zurbarán artworks as well as the significance of the collection as a whole .
Our experience of art develops from the interaction of several cognitive and affective processes ; the beginning of which is a visual scan of the artwork .
When regarding an artwork , a viewer gathers information through a series fixations , interspersed by rapid movements of the eye called saccades .
The direction of saccades is determined by an interaction between the goals of the observer and the physical properties of the different elements of the scene ( e.g. colour , texture , brightness etc ) .
Importantly , studying eye movements offers an insight that does not depend on the participants ’ beliefs , memories or subjective impressions of the artwork .
Previous eye tracking research has highlighted the potential to transform the ways we understand visual processing in the arts ( see for example Brieber 2014 ; Binderman et al. , 2005 ) and at the same time offers a direct way of studying several important factors of a museum visit ( Filippini Fantoni et al. , 2013 ; Heidenreich & Turano 2011 ; Milekic 2010 ) .
Zurbarán ’s cycle of Jacob and his Sons has been on display in the Long Room at Auckland Castle for over 250 years .
It is the only cycle to be preserved in purpose-built surroundings in the UK , and one of very few of its kind in the world .
It has a long history in scholarship ( Baron & Beresford 2014 ) , but many key aspects of its production and significance have not yet been fully understood .
In this study we used eye-tracking in the first stage of exploring audience experience of the extensive Spanish art collections of County Durham , of which the 13 Zurbarán artworks ( there are actually only 12 Zurbarán artworks , the 13th Benjamin , is a copy by Arthur Pond ) are a key part of , to investigate the ways in which audiences look at Spanish art , how aesthetic experience is evaluated and whether audiences can be encouraged to approach art in different ways .
This pilot project primarily investigated how participants visually explore artworks and provides new insights into the potential eye-tracking has to transform the ways we understand visual processing in arts and culture and at the same time offer a direct way of studying several important factors of a museum visit , namely to assess the effects of label characteristics on visitor visual behaviour .
Stranger Things Happen -
Water Off a Black Dog ’s Back
Rachel Rook took Carroll home to meet her parents two months after she first slept with him .
For a generous girl , a girl who took off her clothes with abandon , she was remarkably close-mouthed about some things .
In two months Carroll had learned that her parents lived on a farm several miles outside of town ; that they sold strawberries in summer , and Christmas trees in the winter .
He knew that they never left the farm ; instead , the world came to them in the shape of weekend picnickers and driveby tourists .
Do you think your parents will like me ? " he said .
He had spent the afternoon preparing for this visit as carefully as if he were preparing for an exam .
He had gotten his hair cut , trimmed his nails , washed his neck and behind his ears .
The outfit he had chosen , khaki pants and a blue button-down shirt -- no tie -- lay neatly folded on the bed .
He stood before Rachel in his plain white underwear and white socks , gazing at her as if she were a mirror .
" No , " she said .
It was the first time she had been to his apartment , and she stood square in the center of his bedroom , her arms folded against her body as if she was afraid to sit down , to touch something .
" Why ? "
" My father will like you , " she said .
" But he likes everyone .
My mother 's more particular --
she thinks that you lack a serious nature . "
Carroll put on his pants , admiring the crease .
" So you 've talked to her about me . "
" Yes . "
" But you have n't talked about her to me . "
" No . "
" Are you ashamed of her ? "
Rachel snorted .
Then she sighed in a way that seemed to suggest she was regretting her decision to take him home .
" You 're ashamed of me , " he guessed , and Rachel kissed him and smiled and did n't say anything .
Rachel still lived on her parents ' farm , which made it all the more remarkable that she had kept Carroll and her parents apart for so long .
It suggested a talent for daily organization that filled Carroll 's heart with admiration and lust .
She was nineteen , two years younger than Carroll ; she was a student at Jellicoh College and every weekday she rose at seven and biked four miles into town , and then back again on her bike , four miles uphill to the farm .
Carroll met Rachel in the Jellicoh College library , where he had a part-time job .
He sat at the checkout desk , stamping books and reading Tristram Shandy for a graduate class ; he was almost asleep when someone said , " Excuse me . "
He looked up .
The girl who stood before the tall desk was red-headed .
Sunlight streaming in through a high window opposite her lit up the fine hairs on her arm , the embroidered flowers on the collar of her white shirt .
The sunlight turned her hair to fire and Carroll found it difficult to look directly at her .
" Can I help you ? " he said .
She placed a shredded rectangle on the desk , and Carroll picked it up between his thumb and forefinger .
Pages hung in tatters from the sodden blue spine .
Title , binding , and covers had been gnawed away .
" I need to pay for a damaged book , " she said .
" What happened ? Did your dog eat it ? " he said , making a joke .
" Yes , " she said , and smiled .
" What 's your name ? " Carroll said .
Already , he thought he might be in love .
Local municipalities in Italy ask taxes from religious schools
Sunday , August 2 , 2015
In the past few days in Italy , several municipalities have started asking religious schools to pay taxes for property and local services , despite the resistance of the Catholic Church .
Instituto Gonzaga , a catholic school in Milan . Image : Friedrichstrasse .
The request of the municipalities results from the sentence of the Italian Supreme Court of Cassation on July 8 , recognising as legitimate the request of the Municipality of Livorno asking religious schools to pay property taxes .
Requests have come from the Municipality of Bogliasco , next to Genova , and from the deputies of Movimento 5 Stelle ( M5S ) of the regional counsel of Lombardy .
The first case is of the mayor Luca Pastorino that in last years received several refusals of his requests for payment because of the religious nursery school and retirement home .
In the second case , the M5S party asks to the regional government to assure the local administrations of the region regularly apply the sentence of the Supreme Court .
The case on which the Court has ruled was of the religious schools Santo Spirito and Immacolata in Livorno , Tuscany , to pay over 422,000 euros in arrears for the period from 2004 to 2009 .
The request was advanced by the Municipality of Livorno in 2010 .
The city reasoned , " because the users of the private schools pay a frequency fee , this kind of activity is considered as a commercial one " ( ( it ) ) .
In 2014 the Italian municipal tax discipline has changed from the ICI system to the IMU system by the Monti government .
A mean cost per student criterion is used to tax only the schools that receive a fee higher than the mean cost per student fixed by the State .
The new law is not retroactive , so the taxes requested in arrears from 2006 to 2009 are under the ICI system .
Minister of Education Stefania Giannini said a " more general reflection " ( ( it ) ) is needed .
Claudio De Vincenti , undersecretary to the prime minister , said " a discussion table will be opened with the non-profit associations , religious association included " ( ( it ) ) .
Undersecretary for Education Mr. Toccafondi says " many schools will increase their fees or they will quit . Then the State will have to find new resources to build new structures and manage them " ( ( it ) ) .
Also the president of the Lombardy region , Roberto Maroni , has reacted by proposing some regional counter-measures to finance private schools .
The secretary general of CEI ( Italian Episcopal Conference ) , Nunzio Galantino , has called the sentence " dangerous " ( ( it ) ) and " ideological " ( ( it ) ) :
" We face a dangerous sentence .
Who takes the decisions , do it with less ideology .
Because I have the clear sensation that with this way of thinking , they wait the praise of some ideologized supporters .
Indeed , they do n't understand what kind of good service private schools held " ( ( it ) ) .
Italian secularist associations are concerned the Government will modify the law in order to maintain an exception for religious schools .
The secularist magazine MicroMega describe the court 's judgement as historic .
The Union of Rationalist Atheists and Agnostics ( UAAR ) has launched a petition which now has more than 11,000 signatures , asking the government to respect and execute the sentence of the Supreme Court .
It is also encouraging citizens to ask for application of the law in their local municipalities .
The day it rained in the garden
The first drops of rain fell onto the parched stones from a cloudless blue sky .
They disappeared immediately , drunk down into the mineral silence .
The garden paused , and everything held its breath and waited .
More rain would come .
Everyone knew , beyond belief or necessity that the time had come .
And with it , the rain .
Heavy oily drops bounced from leaf to grass to dusty ground , gathering in stems and folds on the way .
Yet still the sky was a hard polished blue with not a cloud in sight .
Still the garden held its breath .
It would not be long now .
A spattering of drops plucked memories from deep in the roots , shivering through shoots and tendrils , humus and stone .
Wispy vapour trails marbled the blue surface above .
And then it rained for good .
We sat on the porch watching , no longer daring to dart out and leap around in the downfall as drops turned to torrents and the staccato tapping on the roof climaxed to a thunderous roar .
Pools erupted and overflowed along the edges of the lawn , cascading around the raspberry canes and over the flower beds .
Earthworms rose up from the water-laden earth where they could no longer breath and wriggled and struggled fro air on the surface , writhing and swimming for a safe haven .
Water burst over the barrels and cans standing under the eaves and gutters , flooding the pathways , carrying away all that was n’t fixed solid and licking at the stairs to the back porch before climbing each step and lapping against the planks we were sitting on , a wooden raft surrounded by angry water and martial beat drum , drum , drumming on the roof above .
We slipped out feet over the sides and when we felt the fish , some as big as logs , some as small as leaves , nibble at our feet , we leant over to watch them fraying and frolicking under the choppy surface .
Waves lapped at the porch , washing away the boxes , and bowls , and the dog ’s basket .
The rocking chair , the watering can , boxes of cuttings , and tied-up newspapers , all floated away as we slammed the kitchen door shut and retreated to the front room we gazed out at the river that the street had become .
The sky was pewter smeared with charcoal now , and pressed down hard on the rooftops , slowly dissolving everything below .
When the water rippled into the hallway , we splashed our way to the staircase and then up as it nipped at our heels .
Outside the other houses were rocks surrounded by sea with mermaids swimming all around , flapping their scaly tails and hauling themselves up , to fall backwards into the crest of the oncoming waves .
And as they swam they sang , their voices born on the winds and the salt and the rain , and we could hear them singing , He is coming , He is coming .
And they combed their long hair in preparation .
We waved and called , and they laughed and played , tantalising , their seaweed locks just out of reach .
With a flick of the tail they were off , still singing , He is coming , He is coming , until their voices were lost in the noise of the rain and the water .
A great whiskered head arose , then a belly , wet and sleek , long enough to wrap itself twice around the world .
“ Is it him ? ” we asked each other , nudging elbows and climbing onto the chairs .
We pulled off wet socks and shoes , letting them float away on the tide , before the great worm turned and the wake engulfed the creaking , cracking house .
We clambered up onto the roof , sliding on the tiles and clinging to chimney stacks , sheltering our eyes from the driving downpour .
The sky was black , and the stormy sea all the deepest , darkest blues and greens and greys and flecked with white where the sea-horses galloped .
The waters broke making way for the gnarled head of a whale , spouting water high against the clouds before opening its whiskered maw and in a looming , booming voice called : He is coming , He is coming .
The chimneys washed away , so we scrambled onto the blue-black back encrusted with barnacles and cockles like stars in a night sky and held on tight as he rode the waves , dipping and blowing , dipping and blowing .
The wind and the rain tugged at our hair .
And still it rained .
We heard a fearsome creaking and cracking and before our eyes a great patch of sky peeled away , deeping down in the troughs and riding the crests with torn sails set against the wind .
It was a galleon with masts like a dead man ’s fingers , tarred timbers groaning and a mermaid sat on the bow as he ship dipped and passed .
He is coming , He is coming , she sang out .
And just as the wash hit us , prising us from the whale ’s speckled back and down into the sea , someone threw down a knotted rope and we hung on for dear life .
The singing sailors hauled us aboard chanting , He ’s a coming - ha ! He ’s a coming - ha !
And we fell onto the deck like fish bursting from a net .
The Captain stood above us dressed in jewels and finery from a thousand pillagings .
How to Wash Overalls in a Washing Machine
Whether you are a working man or just a little cutie trying to stay cute , those overalls are going to need washing sooner or later .
The straps on adults ’ overalls often get so twisted during the wash that one wishes she had just used an old fashioned washboard instead .
Your appliances are also murder on the straps , which are almost always the first things to wear out on your overalls .
This article will show you how to save time and prevent wear , extending the life of your overalls until they are so soft you could wear them to bed .
Steps
Wash alone or with " like " clothing .
It ’s best to wash adults ’ overalls alone , especially men ’s .
However , it is okay to wash just a few items with them , like blue jeans .
What you do n’t want to wash with them is anything that can get twisted up with the straps , like women ’s long sleeve shirts or kids ’ blankets .
Think similar clothing , minus the twisty-ness .
Just do the denim and canvas stuff together .
Fasten the straps to the bib .
If you did n’t know already , the bib is the top front part with the breast pockets .
Go ahead and fasten both straps before you wash .
This will help keep them from twisting up during the wash .
Use twist ties to keep the straps fastened .
This step will reapportion years of your life in the long run .
Do n’t skip it .
Take the 20 seconds to use a couple twist ties on the fasteners to make sure they do n’t come loose .
If your washing machine is worth its salt , it will undo those straps in a heartbeat and tie them in a sheet bend unless you prevent it .
All it takes is two twist ties and a few seconds of patience .
Empty the pockets .
Overalls have more pockets than pants .
The bib has a wallet pocket and a watch pocket .
Kids put rocks , candy , and bugs in these .
Men put cell phones and small tools in them .
Women defy the laws of purse-space , so when it comes to bib pockets , the sky is the limit .
Make sure all the pockets are empty .
Move the strap adjusters around .
You ’ve probably got them just the way you like them , but if you move the adjusters up or down on the straps occasionally , the straps will last longer .
Depending on the adjusters , you may be able to leave them a little loose too .
The straps wear out fastest around the adjusters over the course of numerous wash and dry cycles ( not to mention being out in the elements if they are work clothes ) .
Moving them distributes the wear and tear of washing .
This is the same idea as rotating tires .
You know about rotating your tires , do n't you ?
Tips
If you wash your overalls alone or in a light load , use about half the detergent called for and less water .
Leave the straps fastened and twist-tied to the bib when you throw them in the dryer .
This will cut down on some of the racket , but you 're still going to hear them .
Warnings
The paper-type twist ties will deteriorate a little , but the dryer filter screen will catch the fallout .
Plastic-type twist ties will hold up in the wash , but may or may not melt in your dryer .
Use with caution .
How to Detect Arrogant People
Do you always seem to cross paths with people who are stuck on themselves , intolerant of people different from them , rude or downright arrogant ?
These people can be a great source of potential pain , and this article is here to help you sort the arrogant from the not-so-arrogant .
Steps
Pay attention to their conversations .
Do n't eavesdrop , but when they 're talking to you or to those around you , listen to them .
Is it always about them ?
Do they get mad or irritated if the centre of attention moves to someone else ?
These are good signs of arrogance .
Arrogance and smugness is often a reflection of limited life experience , and feeling concerned that those with greater life experience " have got something over them " .
Rather than seeking to find out more through questions and learning ( actions viewed by them as showing vulnerability ) , arrogant people tend to generalize from their limited , narrow life experiences and try to impose their small worldview on others .
Jealousy of your achievements or seeming lifestyle can cause another person to feel smug or arrogant about something they think they do better than you or own / have that you do n't .
Arrogant people have an extremely strong need to look good .
When you make them look bad - even if it is the slightest offense - they will usually be very mad at you .
This happens when you question ( or at least seem to question ) their appearance , intelligence , athletic abilities , or anything else relating to their self-image .
Challenge their worldview .
Do n't be aggressive –– just skeptical and curious .
If they get upset , gauge their anger .
If it 's minimal , they may be simply having a bad day .
But if they 're enraged , then they may see you as questioning their ' perfect little world . '
And having one of those is usually indicative of arrogance .
At some point or another , most people realize that the world does n't revolve around them .
Arrogant people counteract this by creating an atmosphere that revolves around them , and get angry if they 're reminded of the real world .
Ambiguity frightens arrogant people because it suggests imperfection , change and lack of certainty ( realities we all must contend with as best we can ) .
As such , instead of accepting that the world behaves randomly and at times totally averse to one 's preferences , the arrogant person seeks to control everything and everyone , which of course , is an impossible mission .
Reality hurts when it intrudes ; as such , an arrogant person is less likely than other people to self-reflect or analyse , thereby not seeing their own imperfections .
They may also give themselves undue credit for positive achievements instead of acknowledging the input of others or of circumstances .
Learn the quality of their friendships .
Do n't be nosy or gossipy , but if they are happy with someone one day and hateful with them the next , that 's a sign of them having a lot of fair weather friends .
That 's a sign of arrogance , since it is very hard to be a truly good friend to someone who 's stuck on themselves .
Prideful people have a strong need to look good , and being self-sufficient is an effective way to do that .
Since being a good friend to someone usually means helping them , they often ca n't stand the thought of a good friendship .
Ironically , arrogant people often ca n't understand why they do n't have any reliable and supportive friends .
How do they treat those not like themselves ?
In other words , how do they treat those with different beliefs , cultural backgrounds and ways of seeing the world ?
If it 's inherently negative , then they 're either over-zealous , ignorant of other people or what to avoid those that contradict their fantasy land that caters to them and them only .
Determine this based on their general personality and the people they 're interacting with .
Many times prideful people have a serious ' my-way's-the-only-way ' attitude .
This is simply a protective mechanism for their false image or their fantasy land .
What 's their personality like ?
Take note of how they act , talk , and use their social status .
Do they have a general sense of ' coolness ? '
Are they a chatterbox ?
Do they act like they own the place , or act like the ' big dog ? '
Are they very keen on their self-image ?
Many arrogant people have a false charm that no one seems to see through .
But the arrogant person is usually more than happy to show their cruel side to those that they do n't like .
When they are cruel , their friends will usually ignore it or not do anything to stop it since they 're afraid that they 'll be treated badly by their ' friend . '
Mention people you know that they do n't like .
This is n't meant to begin a conflict , but to gauge their rivalries , annoyances and enmities .
If their condemnation seems to be reasonable , they probably are n't hubristic .
If it 's harsh , they are .
For the most part , arrogant people see people that they do n't like as threats to their perfect little world .
The more they hate someone , the more dangerous that person is to their fantasy land .
And in turn , the bigger the threat , the harsher the criticism .
Ask around to see what they 've been saying about you .
If they have been saying bad things about you , they may simply not like you .
If they 're nice to your face , but talk bad about you behind your back like it 's their favourite hobby , then they probably have a problem with pride .
Arrogant people often subconsciously know that they do n't have any good friends .
They compensate for this by creating the impression that they have a lot of friends - they have a ' quantity , not quality ' mentality .
Then they simply insult their trophy friends when they are n't looking .

Abstract .
Today ’s generation will not survive a day without the help of lighting .
In fact , someone ’s productivity , particularly at night , depends on the presence of a good lighting and it seems that it is a daily necessity .
Lighting takes a large part on the consumption of household electrical energy particularly in the Philippines .
There are different type of lighting bulbs used at home can affect the overall lighting consumption .
Nowadays , most commonly and widely used bulb in the household is the Compact Fluorescent Light ( CFL ) .
However , the main problem of CFL is the mercury they contain .
In addition to this is the harmful effect of mercury such as Emission of UV Radiation .
In response to the said problem , this project study gives solution to the problem of the society concerning environment , health and safety as well energy conservation , by developing a segmented compact light-emitting diode ( SCLED ) bulb from busted CFL that are efficient , economical , and does not contain toxic chemicals .
1. Introduction
Based on the results of the 2011 Household Energy Consumption Survey ( HECS ) , electricity remains as the most common source of energy used by households particularly in the Philippines .
About 87 percent of 21.0 million households used electricity from March to August 2011 .
As of 2016 , the demand for electricity in the residential is leading among the different sectors .
It is often grouped depending on its uses that are distributed for heating and cooling , lighting , operating appliances etc [ 1 ]
Figure 1 .
January - june 2016 philippine power demand
Now that the world is in the age where lighting seems to be a daily necessity , typical homes as shown in figure 1 , consume nearly 27 percent of the energy used today : making lighting as the major source of electricity consumption .
Lighting plays a large part on the consumption of household electrical energy ; it consumes about 18 % of the total generated electricity of total energy consumption in residential sectors as shown in figure 2 [ 2 ] .
Figure 2 .
Estimated electricity use in residential sector
One of the main factors in lighting energy consumption is the light bulb .
The use of correct and appropriate type of light bulb improves the efficiency of energy usage .
There are three general types of lighting that are widely used in the household nowadays : the ( light-emitting diode ) LED bulb , ( compact fluorescent light ) CFL bulb and the incandescent bulb .
But each of them has their perks and perils [ 3 ] .
Unfortunately , most of the time , people in the residential end up choosing a lamp based on it is price rather than its efficiency and this cause us to pay for our lighting more than necessary .
Today , CFLs are the most used lighting sources in the household .
Using CFLs will allow people to decrease their energy consumption ; also it is a good start to decrease greenhouse emissions .
However , the main problem of CFLs is the mercury they contain .
When products and wastes containing mercury are improperly disposed of , mercury is released into the air , ground or water .
It is persistent in the environment ; it never breaks down nor goes away .
In addition to the harmful effects of mercury is that it emits Ultraviolet ( UV ) Radiation .
This UV radiation interacts with the chemicals on the inside of the bulb to generate light .
The acute and chronic effects are the normal responses of the skin to UVR ; acute reactions considered will be erythema ( sunburn ) and vitamin D production .
Skin aging and skin cancer will be discussed as those reactions produced by prolonged or repeated UVR exposure [ 4 ] .
In response to the aforementioned situation where the three types of lights are compared by their efficiency and effectiveness as light sources , the proponents conducted this study .
Since the CFLs are the most commonly used light bulbs in the residential and has a great compatibility to LED in terms of design and materials , the proponents conducted a study about innovating and recycling CFL into a more efficient and environment friendly LED light bulb .
Falling
You ’re on the 236th-level Kaiserstrasse moving sidewalk when you see her .
You ’re leaning on the railing , waiting to ask Derya about a job , watching the glittering stream of mites that arc over half the sky — flying up to rewind their nanosprings in the stratospheric sunlight , flying down to make Frankfurt run .
You never get tired of watching them .
She ’s on the Holbeinsteg bridge .
Someone ’s hung it up here — a hundred meters of clean gray and green twentieth-century modernism , plucked up from the river Main and suspended in the chilly air 2,360 meters up , between a lump of wooded parkland and a cluster of antique subway cars .
She ’s wearing a 1950s sundress and a broad-brimmed hat , and it ’s like an essay on the last century — the austere steel bridge , the bright blobs of subway graffiti , and her yellow dress , flapping against her legs as she climbs over the bridge ’s rail .
A picture of elegance and style from the age of money , violence , and simplicity .
She ’s a strawberry blonde , slim , her skin blank and virginal as new butter .
She ’s beyond the rail now , hanging out over the mountain - high drop .
Thin translucent shadows move across her — the shadows of the neosilk-and-nanotube filaments that hang the city from the hundreds of five-kilometer-high towers that encircle it .
( A civic agent notices you noticing , and attaches itself to your infospace , whispering statistics —
“ Each object ’s suspension must weather a class 5 hurricane and the destruction of 80 % of the towers ” —
“ Frankfurt ’s current population is stable at 53 million ” —
“ Average age 62 , birth rate 0.22 , net immigration of half a million a year ” —
“ Current personal squatright : 311 cubic meters per resident ” —
until you brush it away . )
You ’re watching her lean out .
The wind whips her hair , ruffles the skirt around her knees .
She must be a tourist .
You remember your first trip to the upper levels : leaning over the edge into the angry swarm of mites , whirring and buzzing warnings and shoving you back like a million mosquito chaperones .
Everyone tries it once — Except that there are n’t any mites around her .
You clutch the railing .
Hot , animal fear surges in your chest .
She looks up at you and , across the gap of forty meters , smiles a brilliant , heartbreaking smile .
Then she lets go and falls .
You scream .
“ Fucking airsurfers , ” says Derya .
He steps off the moving sidewalk near you : tall , hook-nosed , the fashionable whorls of pox and acne making constellations of his cheeks and chest ; the glowing , formal tattoos of his committees and lifebrands adorning his massive triceps .
You swallow on a dry throat .
Derya , of all people , hearing you scream !
He gives you a hooded look .
“ They infect themselves with some designer virus -
it lets them hack the city ’s person-recognition systems .
So the mites do n’t see them when they jump .
Watch — ”
She ’s swept past the whalelike oval of the public pool on the 202nd , past the sloping mandala of the Google of offices on the 164th .
At the 131st , below her , is the old Stock Exchange , hung upside-down now as a hipster den .
Now the mites are finally closing in .
A silver swarm coalesces around the 164th , and she vanishes into it , like a snip of scallion into cloudy miso soup .
When the cloud disperses , she ’s standing on one of the Stock Exchange ’s upside-down overhangs .
She waves , antlike , then crawls through a dormer window .
“ It ’s not funny , ” Derya says .
“ They ’re a huge drain on emergency preparedness .
Ripple effects are causing project slowdowns ... ”
“ Freeloaders drive systemic evolution , ” you find yourself saying .
“ Do n’t you quote the founders at me , ” Derya snaps .
“ The Free Society is fragile .
The minute enough people find anticontributive behavior cool , the party ’s over —
it ’s back to capitalist competition or state control . ”
He stares until you meet his eye .
“ You even talk to those people -
are you paying attention ? —
you even talk to them , your rep will be trashed on all the major servers .
You wo n’t work , you wo n’t party , you ’ll be defriended by every one of your tribes .
Got it ? ”
Her broad-brimmed hat is still sailing on the wind .
The mites missed it .
It cuts between the towers of the 50th .
The upside-down trading floor is deserted .
There are heaps of yellowed euros and deutschmarks dumped here , like snowdrifts .
Wood panel , marble .
Silence .
And the air is strangely clear .
You realize : no mites .
The city has no eyes or ears here .
You walk through empty , miteless rooms , stepping around light fixtures .
Then she ’s there , in a doorway .
Her eyes , bright blue , radiant .
Her smile , with that chaste yellow dress , so bashful .
She comes to you .
“ You want it ? ” she says .
“ You want to be infected ?
You want to fly ? ”
You nod .
Eyes closing , she leans in for the kiss .
New Zealand begins process to consider changing national flag design
Thursday , May 7 , 2015
On Tuesday , the New Zealand government announced the start of a public process to suggest designs for a new national flag , and determine whether their citizens would prefer a different national flag over the current one .
The current flag of New Zealand .
The current New Zealand flag is partially based on the United Kingdom 's flag ;
the new one would be unique to New Zealand .
The government 's Flag Consideration Project has planned a number of conferences and roadshows as part of this process , with the first meeting set to take place in Christchurch on May 16 .
According to the New Zealand Herald , Emeritus Professor John Burrows , the chairman of the project 's panel of twelve , said New Zealand 's flag has never before been open to public choice .
Professor Burrows also said resources and kits would be accessible for schools and communities , " For example , schools can run their own flag discussions and referendums to mirror the formal process as part of their own learning exercise " .
People were encouraged to submit their designs online at www.flag.govt.nz and suggest what the flag should mean on www.standfor.co.nz .
Names of participants would be engraved , at their option , on a flag pole monument to be built in the nation 's capital , Wellington .
New Zealand 's Prime Minister John Key said he believes redesigning the flag now has a " strong rationale " .
Mr Key promoted the campaign for a unique New Zealand flag on Waitangi Day - February 6 - this year .
Of the public process , he said , " In the end I 'll have one vote in each referendum just like every other New Zealander on the electoral roll " .
The New Zealand government intends to hold two referendums to reach a verdict on the flag , at an estimated cost of NZ $ 26 million , although a recent poll found only a quarter of citizens favoured changing the flag .
This is a decrease from the year before , when it was forty percent .
The first referendum is to be held from November 20 to December 11 , selecting a single new flag design out of about four finalists .
Voters would then choose between the new flag and their current flag early in 2016 .
4. Discussion .
We hypothesized that the children , who were over the age of six at the time of collection , would have adult-like SI interpretations .
We expected that the use of a training session and then the format of the question would guide participants towards evaluating pragmatic felicity over providing truth value judgments , and would result in adult-like interpretations .
Further , we posited that if our initial hypothesis was not supported , and in fact there was some non-adult-like performance , that there would be significant variability among the conditions , with cardinal numbers having the highest performance and some the weakest .
On the surface , it does seem as if there is variability and perhaps a larger sample size or more items could lead to a significant finding ( see limitations below ) , but at least for this study , the only significant finding was the difference between cardinal numbers and some .
Significant differences were not observed between all and cardinal numbers or all and some .
4.1. LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS .
This study is limited in its power and generalizability .
It serves as a reminder of the work that needs to be completed for the cross-linguistic study of SI in particular and acquisition more generally .
Bantu languages are not included in studies of acquisition often enough despite the numerous languages in this linguistic grouping and the millions of people using them .
Future studies need to include more participants and more items to increase power .
Future studies should also include a larger age range of children to document the age at which adult-like performance emerges .
Related cross-cultural studies have resulted in insufficient statistical power , but interesting trends ( e.g. , Nedwick , 2014 ) .
Follow-up studies with increased stimuli and participants are needed .
In a future study , it is also important to consider if additional training in the difference between reporting on felicity and truth value judgments would impact results , or if more naturalistic experimental conditions ( e.g. , demonstrating actions using real objects instead of two-dimensional depictions ) would be beneficial .
Previous studies in this region of sub-Saharan Africa have found evidence of cultural differences in testing behavior ( Hein , Reich , Marks , Thuma , & Grigorenko , 2016 ) .
The current study is too small to make strong conclusions with regard to cultural differences and experimental methods ;
however , in the study by Hein and colleagues it was found that children responded more or less frequently based on factors such as stimuli type .
In the current study , the responses from two children were not included because they responded the same way to every item through the training and all test items .
More specifically , they answered “ yes ” that the puppet described the pictures well .
It is possible that these two children understood the task and really did believe that the puppet did not produce any poor descriptions , and in this regard , are not yet adult-like in their SI interpretations .
This is unlikely as they said that even the first training item was said well .
It is also possible though that these two children were attempting to please the data collectors , or be polite , and that “ yes ” was in some ways a default answer to be provided when having to respond verbally in a test context .
Additional training with the methodology could improve outcomes .
The puppets used were picked specifically for this task with careful attention to their appearance .
Upon arrival at the school , however , it became clear that the children were not accustomed to playing with puppets and that the data collection would be a novel experience for them .
Further exploration with greater cardinal number ranges could also prove interesting .
Numbers through five in the participating communities are most often expressed with native Chitonga words while numbers greater than five are typically indicated using English borrowings .
The cardinal numbers included in this study were only one through five in order to avoid additional item variability , but larger numbers should be included in future research .
5. Conclusion .
Albeit limited , these results provide valuable insight into SI interpretation by Chitonga-speaking children and demonstrate that pragmatic inference acquisition likely follows the order identified in previous research , but appears to be completed at a later age in this language .
This interesting combination of findings – expected hierarchy of difficulty , but differing age of acquisition – is an important addition to our growing cross-linguistic knowledge of SI and could be the result of language-specific differences in the use of SI lexical items or methodological differences .
How to Hypnotize a Chicken
Anyone who 's spent a lot of time on a farm with chickens is probably familiar with this trick .
Those who 've never heard of this will be amazed to see a chicken lie perfectly still after these instructions are followed .
Biologists think that fear causes this " hypnosis , " which may be an attempt to " play dead " to fool predators .
Method One of Two : Hypnotizing a Chicken
Hold the chicken down on a flat surface .
Hold the chicken with one hand supporting the breast .
Place it down so that its breast is carrying its weight and rests on the ground .
Continue to hold its feet so the grand experiment can continue .
You can place the chicken on its breast instead .
Press gently down on its back , and gently move its legs back if it tries to stand up .
Wiggle your finger .
Hold the bird down gently with one hand .
Put one finger on your other hand just in front of its beak tip , without touching it .
Move the finger backward to about 4 inches ( 10 cm ) away , then back again .
Repeat until the chicken stops moving or squawking .
Let go of its legs .
The chicken should be " hypnotized " and cease to struggle .
It will lie there for anywhere from 30 seconds to several minutes .
Draw a line in front of its beak instead .
If the chicken was n't hypnotized , try this alternative .
Using chalk , a stick , or your finger , draw a line on the ground 12 " ( 30 cm ) long .
Start near the chicken 's beak and draw the line slowly outward , in front of its head .
Wake it up by clapping .
Be nice to your feathered friend and let it get back to its business .
Clap your hands or give it a gentle shove until it jumps up and walks away .
Method Two of Two : Reducing Stress in the Chicken
Understand the hypnotic effect .
Researchers call this effect " tonic immobility " .
" When a chicken or another animal with this tendency becomes frightened , its heart rate lowers and it stops moving .
This may be an attempt to play dead , discouraging predators that prefer live prey .
Unlike an opossum , the chicken gives an unconvincing act , as it continues to blink and breathe in an obvious way . "
Keep the chicken upright or on its side .
While it 's not uncommon to transport a chicken by its feet , this upside-down hold risks breaking the chicken 's hip .
Hypnosis techniques that involve laying a chicken on its back may " succeed " by cutting off its air supply .
This can cause the chicken significant discomfort , leading to fainting or even , rarely , death .
Keep hypnosis short and infrequent .
It 's not completely clear how much stress this hypnosis causes .
Even if it does , the chicken should n't suffer as long as you let it go soon afterward .
Hours of stress , or regular exposure to stressful situations , can cause serious health problems .
Get your chickens used to humans and novelty .
Even prolonged eye contact seems to have an effect .
Living in stimulating environments with new objects may also help .
Hens raise in battery cages stay " hypnotized " longer , possibly because of greater fear .
Watch for signs of stress .
Abnormal feathering , constant preening , or delays in egg-laying are all signs of a stressed chicken .
While hypnotizing is unlikely to cause serious harm , any type of stress is more damaging to a chicken in this state .
Ichiyō Higuchi
Ichiyō Higuchi ( 樋口 一葉 Higuchi Ichiyō , May 2 , 1872 – November 23 , 1896 ) was a pen name of Japanese author Natsu Higuchi ( 樋口 奈津 Higuchi Natsu ) , also known as Natsuko Higuchi ( 樋口 夏子 Higuchi Natsuko ) .
Specializing in short stories , she was one of the first important writers to appear in the Meiji period ( 1868 - 1912 ) and Japan 's first prominent woman writer of modern times .
She wrote relatively little as a result of living a brief life — she died at 24 — but her stories had a large impact on Japanese literature and she is still appreciated by the Japanese public today .
Efforts to become a writer
She , her mother , and younger sister made ends meet by doing needlework , washing , and other jobs .
In 1892 , after seeing the success of a classmate , Kaho Tanabe , who wrote a novel , Higuchi decided to become a novelist to support her family .
Nevertheless , her initial efforts at writing fiction were in the form of a short story , a form to which she would remain true .
In 1891 she met her future advisor who would help , she assumed , this poet-turned-fiction-writer and connect her with editors : Tosui Nakarai .
She fell in love with him right away , not knowing that , at 31 , he had a reputation as a womanizer .
Nor did she realize that he wrote popular literature which aimed to please the general public and in no way wished to be associated with serious literature .
Her mentor did not return her passionate , if discreet , love for him , and instead treated her as a younger sister .
This failed relationship would become a recurrent theme in Higuchi 's fiction .
Eventually , she got the break she was so eager for :
her first stories were published in a minor newspaper under her pen name , Ichiyo Higuchi .
The stories from this first period ( 1892 – 94 ) suffered from the excessive influence of Heian poetry .
Higuchi felt compelled to demonstrate her classical literary training .
The plots were thin , there was little development of character and they were loaded down by excessive sentiment , especially when compared to what she was writing concurrently in her diary .
But she was developing rapidly .
Several of her trademark themes appear ; for example , the triangular relationship among a lonely , beautiful , young woman who has lost her parents , a handsome man who has abandoned her ( and remains in the background ) , and a lonely and desperate ragamuffin who falls in love with her .
Another theme Higuchi repeated was the ambition and cruelty of the Meiji middle class .
The story " Umoregi " ( " In Obscurity " ) signaled Higuchi 's arrival as a professional writer .
It was published in the prestigious journal Miyako no Hana in 1892 , only nine months after she had started writing in earnest .
Her work was noticed and she was recognized as a promising new author .
Her last years
In 1893 , Higuchi , her mother and her sister abandoned their middle class house and , with a grim determination to survive , moved to a poor neighborhood where they opened a stationery store that before long failed .
Their new dwelling was a five-minute walk from Tokyo 's ill-famed red-light district , the Yoshiwara .
Her experience living in this neighborhood would provide material for several of her later stories , especially " Takekurabe " , ( literally , " Comparing heights " ; " Child 's Play " in the Robert Lyons Danly translation ; also called " Growing Up " in the Edward Seidensticker translation . )
The stories of her mature period ( 1894 – 96 ) were not only marked by her experience living near the red-light district and greater concern over the plight of women , but also by the influence of Ihara Saikaku , a 17th-century writer , whose stories she had recently discovered .
His distinctiveness lay in great part in his acceptance of low-life characters as worthwhile literary subjects .
What Higuchi added was a special awareness of suffering and sensitivity .
To this period belong " Ōtsugomori " ( " On the Last Day of the Year " ) , " Nigorie " ( " Troubled Waters " ) , " Wakare-Michi " ( " Separate Ways " ) , " Jūsan'ya " ( " The Thirteenth Night " ) and " Takekurabe " ( " Child 's Play " ) .
The last two are considered her best work .
With these last stories her fame spread throughout the Tokyo literary establishment .
In her humble home she was visited by other writers , students of poetry , admirers , the curious , critics , and editors requesting her collaboration .
But between constant interruptions and frequent headaches , Higuchi stopped writing .
As her father and one of her brothers had before her , she had caught tuberculosis .
She died on November 23 , 1896 , at the age of twenty-four .
Higuchi 's likeness adorns the Japanese 5000 yen banknote as of fall 2004 , becoming the third woman to appear on a Japanese banknote , after Empress Jingū in 1881 and Murasaki Shikibu in 2000 .
Her best-known stories have been made into movies .
Hundreds dead in Hajj stampede
Thursday , January 12 , 2006
The Plains of Arafat on the day of Hajj
According to the Saudi Interior Ministry over 345 Muslim pilgrims have been killed in a stampede during the annual Hajj pilgrimage near Mecca , Saudi Arabia .
The stampede at Islam 's most holy site happened at Jamarat Bridge , during an event where pebbles are thrown at a pillar to represent the stoning of Satan as part of the final rites of the Hajj .
The stampede began when luggage from a bus tripped pilgrims at the eastern end of the wall , causing a bottleneck .
Those who were tripped were then crushed by the wave of people behind them .
Muslims are required to make a pilgrimage to Mecca during their lifetimes , if physically or financially possible , as it is one of the five pillars of the Islamic faith .
Saudi officials had already provided safeguards by installing an oval wall with padded edges to protect pilgrams from a crush , installed security cameras and placed over 60,000 security personnel in the area .
This is not the first time deadly stampedes have taken place during the Hajj , with the deadliest stampede during the 1991 Hajj , in which 1,426 pilgrims were trampled .
Last week , at least 76 people were killed when the Al-Ghaza Hotel near the Masjid Al-Haram ( Grand Mosque ) collasped , the cause of which is unknown .
Greek court rules worship of ancient Greek deities is legal
Monday , March 27 , 2006
Greek court has ruled that worshippers of the ancient Greek religion may now formally associate and worship at archeological sites .
Prior to the ruling , the religion was banned from conducting public worship at archeological sites by the Greek Ministry of Culture .
Due to that , the religion was relatively secretive .
The Greek Orthodox Church , a Christian denomination , is extremely critical of worshippers of the ancient deities .
Today , about 100,000 Greeks worship the ancient gods , such as Zeus , Hera , Poseidon , Aphrodite , and Athena .
The Greek Orthodox Church estimates that number is closer to 40,000 .
Many neo-pagan religions , such as Wicca , use aspects of ancient Greek religions in their practice ; Hellenic polytheism instead focuses exclusively on the ancient religions , as far as the fragmentary nature of the surviving source material allows .
How to Make a Glowstick
Those glowing Mountain Dew videos with peroxide and baking soda are all hoaxes .
To truly make a glowstick without breaking an already-made glowstick and shoving its contents into a tube ( also known as cheating ) , you 've gotta let your inner scientist out ( along with a few dollars ) .
If you 're still curious , read on .
This is fun for anyone and everyone .
Method One of Two : Using Luminol
Put on protective glasses .
In addition , wear gloves to protect your skin .
It 's also a good idea to not wear your Sunday best .
Throw on some old clothes or put a smock over clothes you want protected .
Some of this stuff is dangerous -- this experiment is not meant for children !
Listen up , kids : You 'll be working with a solution that 's near a 12 on the pH scale .
That basically means do n't swallow it , do n't put it in your eyes , do n't bathe in it , and do n't really expose yourself to it directly at all .
Got it ?
Moving on .
Combine 50 milliliters of hydrogen peroxide and a liter of distilled water in a mixing bowl .
A ceramic bowl will work best , but plastic works too .
Use funnels , measuring tubes , and basters to keep everything well-measured and well away from you .
Hydrogen peroxide is used to replace the luminol 's nitrogen atoms with oxygen .
When that happens , all the substances create a rave and start partying and electrons fly everywhere and what results ?
The glow .
Mix .2 grams of luminol , 4 grams of sodium carbonate , .4 grams of copper sulfate , .5 grams of ammonium carbonate and 1 liter ( 0.3 US gal ) of distilled water in a second bowl .
It is important not to touch the luminol .
Use a funnel to make everything safe and easy .
Unfortunately , these hazardous chemicals will not float freely in mid-air like this graphic suggests .
Yep , unless you 're a coroner or some sort of crazy spy / criminologist you probably do n't have this stuff lying around the house ( hopefully not ... ) .
If you 're dead set on starting your own glowstick business ( worse ideas exist ) , try websites like Alfa Aesar [ 1 ] or Sigma Aldrich [ 2 ] for supplies .
Mix everything well .
Do n't use your hands -- use a metal or plastic utensil of some sort .
Clean the containers and dry them thoroughly .
It 's important to use sanitary , clean tubes for your glowsticks .
The last thing you want is other substances interacting with the reactions you 're depending on to make the substances glow .
Set the correct lid next to each container .
This enables you to seal the containers quickly after filling .
It 's not like the glow will get up and run away from you , but still .
Combine equal amounts of the first and second solution in the container and close the bottles .
Shake them up once the lids are on tightly .
Then turn off the lights !
If it 's not already glowing , something went wrong .
Do over !
Watch as the chemical compound creates a colorful glow .
Take your glowsticks to the party and charge your friends loads of money for them !
But act quickly ...
the glow wo n't last very long .
Expectations crushed ?
Method two to the rescue !
The reaction that the luminol and hydrogen peroxide creates does n't last long at all -- maybe a couple of minutes .
For something that lasts hours , go to the next method ( which is a lot easier to facilitate if you have access to a laboratory , but it 's still worth mentioning ) .
The Valley of Giants
I had buried my parents in their gray marble mausoleum at the heart of the city .
I had buried my husband in a lead box sunk into the mud of the bottom of the river , where all the riverboatmen lie .
And after the war , I had buried my children , all four , in white linen shrouds in the new graveyards plowed into what used to be our farmland : all the land stretching from the river delta to the hills .
I had one granddaughter who survived the war .
I saw her sometimes : in a bright pink dress , a sparkling drink in her hand , on the arm of some foreign officer with brocade on his shoulders , at the edge of a marble patio .
She never looked back at me — poverty and failure and political disrepute being all , these days , contagious and synonymous .
The young were mostly dead , and the old men had been taken away , they told us , to learn important new things and to come back when they were ready to contribute fully .
So it was a city of grandmothers .
And it was in a grandmother bar by the waterfront — sipping hot tea with rum and watching over the shoulders of dockworkers playing mah-jongg — that I first heard of the valley of giants .
We all laughed at the idea , except for a chemist with a crooked nose and rouge caked in the creases of her face , who was incensed .
“ We live in the modern era ! ” she cried .
“ You should be ashamed of yourself ! "
The traveler stood up from the table .
She was bony and rough-skinned and bent like an old crow , with a blue silk scarf and hanks of hair as black as soot .
Her eyes were veined with red .
“ Nonetheless , ” the traveler said , and she walked out .
They were laughing at the chemist as well as at the traveler .
To find anyone still proud , anyone who believed in giants or shame , was hilarious .
The air of the bar was acrid with triumph .
Finding someone even more vulnerable and foolish than we were , after everything had been taken from us — that was a delight .
But I followed the traveler , into the wet streets .
The smell of fish oozed from the docks .
Here and there were bits of charred debris in the gutters .
I caught her at her door .
She invited me in for tea and massage .
Her limbs were weathered and ringed , like the branches of trees in the dry country .
She smelled like honey that has been kept a while in a dark room , a little fermented .
A heady smell .
In the morning , brilliant sunlight scoured the walls and the floor , and the traveler and her pack were gone .
I hurried home .
My house had survived the war with all its brown clay walls intact , though the garden and the courtyard were a heap of blackened rubble .
My house was empty and cold .
I packed six loaves of flatbread , some olives , a hard cheese , one nice dress , walking clothes , my pills and glasses , a jug of wine , a can-teen of water , and a kitchen knife .
I sat in the shadow in my living room for a while , looking at the amorphous mass of the blanket I had been crocheting .
That granddaughter : her parents both worked in the vineyards , and when she was a child , she would play in my courtyard in the after-noons .
When she scraped her knees bloody on the stones , she refused to cry .
She would cry from frustration when the older children could do something that she could n't — like tie knots , or catch a chicken .
How to Make Vegan Cupcakes
Two Methods :
Basic Vanilla Vegan Cupcakes
Basic Chocolate Vegan Cupcakes
No need to give up wicked cakes when you toss the eggs , butter , and milk !
Here 's a great vegan cupcake recipe to use as a base for whatever flavored icing you want to add to it .
They 're guaranteed to be light and fluffy and perfect for any occasion .
Ingredients
Method 1 : Basic Vanilla Vegan Cupcakes :
Servings : 18 - 24 ( fewer if you opt for larger-sized cupcakes )
1 tablespoon ( 15 ml ) apple cider vinegar
1 1/2 cups ( 350 ml ) plain soy milk
2 3/4 cups ( 345 g ) self raising flour
2 teaspoons ( 10 g ) baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup ( 200 g ) sugar
1/2 cup ( 120 ml ) vegetable oil
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
Vegan icing of your choice
Method 2 : Basic Chocolate Vegan Cupcakes :
Makes approx : 20 - 24 cupcakes :
275 g ( 2 cups ) plain or all-purpose flour ( sifted )
100 g ( 3/4 cup ) quality cocoa powder ( sifted )
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
Pinch of salt
450 ml ( 1 - 3/4 cup ) unsweetened soy milk
2 teaspoons red wine or apple cider vinegar
320 g ( 1 - 2/3 cups ) caster / superfine sugar
320 ml ( 1 - 1/4 cups ) sunflower oil ( or coconut oil )
2 tablespoons vanilla extract / essence
Method 1 of 2 : Basic Vanilla Vegan Cupcakes .
Preheat the oven to 180 oC / 350 oF .
Prepare the muffin tray by adding cupcake holders / cases .
Put to one side .
Alternatively , use a silicone cupcake baking sheet with molded holes .
Put the cider vinegar into a small bowl and add the soy milk .
Stir this well and then put to one side .
The mixture will now curdle and this is what should be happening .
Stir together the flour , sugar , baking powder , baking soda and salt .
If you want chocolate cupcakes , add cocoa ( about 1/2 cup ) to this stage .
Stir the oil and vanilla extract into the bowl containing the soy milk and vinegar .
Mix together .
Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and beat together ( by hand or with an electric hand-held mixer ) .
Fill the muffin pan .
Usually fill each paper cupcake holder with about 1/4 cup of batter .
If you prefer larger cupcakes , then add a half a cup but make sure the muffin pan is larger and the cupcake holders are bigger .
Bake for 18 - 20 minutes .
If you can smell the cupcakes earlier , check to make sure they are n't browning earlier ( this means they 're more than ready ) .
If you are n't certain , turn off the oven earlier and let them sit for a few more minutes rather than bake them into rocks .
Wait for the pan to cool down .
Place cupcakes onto a wire rack to cool .
Ice the cupcakes .
The flavor of icing or frosting can be improved by adding a little of your favorite juice to it instead of soy milk or water .
Finished .
Method 2 of 2 : Basic Chocolate Vegan Cupcakes
Preheat the oven to 160 oC / 315 oF .
If using cupcake cases , arrange on a baking sheet now .
If using a silicone cupcake sheet , simply have it ready .
Add the flour , cocoa powder , baking soda and pinch of salt to the mixing bowl .
Mix to combine .
Pour the soy milk , vinegar , sugar , oil and vanilla into another bowl .
Whisk together well .
Pour the liquid mixture into the flour mixture .
Stir to combine thoroughly .
Pour into the cupcake cases or cupcake holes .
Place into the oven .
Bake for 20 to 25 minutes .
If they smell strongly earlier , test with a wooden skewer ; if it returns clean after sticking into a cupcake , they 're ready .
Remove from the oven .
Transfer the cupcakes to a wire cooling rack as quickly as possible when cool enough to handle .
Let cool completely on the rack .
Frost as desired .
Add standard frosting or make vegan butter cream .
Tips
You can add pureed fruit for delicious flavor changes .
One small container of pureed fruit is sufficient for flavoring ( the little containers that children take to school in their lunchboxes . )
Try strawberry , apple , banana , apricot , peach etc .
The cupcakes will not be as light and fluffy , however , so be prepared for a heavier cupcake if you add fruit but the added moisture content is a definite plus .
Instead of using vegan sugar , you can replace it with equal parts maple sugar or rice syrup
Instead of using vegetable oil , try substituting it for walnut or macadamia nut oils if they are available to you .
Coconut oil also produces good results .
And olive oil works fine if it 's all that 's left in the pantry .
You can replace the plain soy milk with other flavors like chocolate or vanilla if you want to experiment with changing the flavor of the cupcakes .
Experiment with the flavors of either recipe by replacing the vanilla extract with fragrant ingredients like neroli orange oil , rosewater , orange blossom water or coconut extract .
York
York is an ancient cathedral city with a history that dates back to before Roman times .
It is situated in Yorkshire , North Yorkshire , England with some of the best preserved historical buildings and structures in Europe .
As of the 2001 census , the population of York was 181,000 .
York is frequently ranked ( often vying with Manchester ) the second most visited city in England after London .
York Minster
Understand
York was known as Eboracum by the Romans , who founded the fortress city on the River Ouse in the year 71 .
York was home first to the Ninth Legion and later the Sixth .
York quickly became one of the most important cities in Roman Britain , and after 211 became the capital of the province Britannia Inferior .
Constantine the Great - later responsible for making Christianity the official religion of the Roman Empire - was first proclaimed Emperor in the city .
Captured by the Vikings 866 , the city quickly took on a new identity as Jorvik ( pronounced " Yor-vik " ) and experienced a major urban revival as a centre of Viking trade and settlement in northern England .
The Coppergate excavations of the 1970s revealed much of this Viking past .
York is a fairly small city - four days is enough to see the major sights although York is a city that reveals its charms to explorers with curiosity and patience .
York is known as England 's " City of Festivals " as there are regular cultural festivals every year .
The official festivals are the Viking Festival , the Festival of Angels , Early Music , Late Music , Horse Racing ( the " Ebor Race Meeting " ) , Multicultural Food and Arts , Chinese New Year , Mystery Plays , Christmas St Nicholas ' Fair , and the Food and Drink Festival .
It 's a romantic city for a weekend break .
York is full of magic and a wonderful place to bring children !
Get in
Most travellers will arrive in York by road ( car or bus ) or rail from other parts of the UK or an airport .
By car
Although York is not directly on any of the main north-south motorways , the connections are reasonably good .
From the south , the quickest route is probably to take the M1 northbound to junction 32 , then the M18 eastbound to junction 2 , the A1M northbound to junction 44 and finally the A64 eastbound to the York Outer Ring Road ( A1237 ) .
Alternatively , you can take the M1 all the way to the A64 , but the upper reaches of the M1 around Sheffield and Leeds can get very congested , especially in the rush hours .
From the west , the A59 and the M62 provide connections from Liverpool and Manchester , and from the north the A1 and the A19 link York with Tyneside , Northumberland and south-eastern Scotland .
Driving into the city centre itself is something to avoid .
Traffic congestion on the main arterial roads serving the city ( especially the A19 on Bootham and the Inner Ring Road ) can get very bad , especially during the rush hours and on Saturday mornings .
The remodelling of some roads near bottleneck junctions to accommodate bicycle lanes has made traffic jams even worse still in recent years , and parking in the city centre is very expensive .
If you are just visiting York for the day , using a Park and Ride [ 1 ] costs a lot less than trying to park in or near the city centre , and there are five sites dotted around the Outer Ring Road .
However , the last buses from the city centre leave at around 8 pm in the evenings and you are not allowed to leave your car in a Park and Ride overnight .
Therefore , if you are staying overnight in York and arriving by car , make sure that your hotel offers parking before you book .
If you are only visiting for the day but staying until late evening , you will need to use a city centre car park .
How to Grow Basil
Three Methods : Starting Seeds Caring for Basil Harvesting and Using Basil
Basil is easy to grow , and transforms ordinary meals into culinary treasures !
Fresh basil not only tastes better than dried , it actually tastes different , almost as if it were not the same herb .
This article outlines how to plant and harvest basil .
Method 1 of 3 : Starting Seeds
1 Choose the kind of basil you wish to grow .
Basil comes in many different varieties , each of which have a unique flavor and smell .
Read up on different types of basil and pick out one - or several - that appeal to you , then order the seeds or buy them at a garden store .
Here are a few ideas :
Cinnamon basil really does smell like the sweet spice , and it also has unusually beautiful and fragrant flowers .
Lemon basil actually contains citral , an aromatic compound found in citrus fruit , and smells very lemony .
Purple basil is often grown for decoration , as well as its scent and flowers .
There are perennial basils which come back year after year , like African Blue Basil ( which has pretty blue veins on its leaves ) and Thai Basil , while most other varieties are annuals , which you 'll have to plant year after year .
Globe and Greek basil are much more difficult to grow , but form pretty little bushes which stay well-contained .
2 Start seed indoors four to six weeks before last frost .
Basil needs warm air and sun to do well , so it 's often easiest to start the seeds indoors instead of risking that they 'll get damaged by frost .
If you live in a hot climate , you can start the seeds outside instead .
To figure out when the last frost will be , consult an almanac or talk with other gardeners in your area .
3 Prepare seed containers .
Fill flats or individual seed containers with a mixture of equal parts perlite , vermiculite , and peat .
Press the mixture slightly to eliminate air pockets .
Dampen the mixture with water so it 's ready to provide the right environment for the basil seeds to germinate .
4 Plant the seeds .
Drop one to two seeds into each container .
Cover them lightly with soil .
Cover containers with clear plastic kitchen wrap , so they stay moist .
Leave the containers in a sunny window .
Twice daily , remove the plastic wrap and sprinkle the containers with more water .
5 Remove the plastic wrap when the sprouts emerge .
When you see the first green tendrils push up through the soil , it 's time to remove the plastic wrap .
Keep watering the sprouts twice daily , never letting the soil dry out .
When the plants become a few inches tall and their leaves mature , it 's time to transplant them to a larger container .
Method 2 of 3 : Caring for Basil
1 Transplant the basil plants .
Once two sets of leaves have formed , basil can be planted into the garden or permanent containers .
Basil does not tolerate frost so do n't plant too early .
It 's best to put basil somewhere where it will get a good deal of sunshine and have well-drained soil .
To plant the basil in the garden , dig holes spaced at least 6 inches apart .
Place the roots in the holes and place soil around the stems .
Pat down soil around the plants to eliminate air pockets .
If you want to plant the basil in a container , make sure it 's large enough to accommodate the number of plants you 're growing ;
they need to be planted 6 inches apart , since they grow quite large .
2 Keep the soil damp , but not soaked .
Basil does best in well-drained soil , and should not be subjected to standing water .
Water the mature basil plants once a day , in the morning , so the water has time to soak in and evaporate rather than sitting on the plants overnight .
3 Pinch off flower heads .
When you see flower buds , pinch them and two pairs of leaves under them off .
Flowers blooming create a hormone change which dramatically reduces the flavor of the leaves , as well as reducing the amount of foliage which grows .
This is called " bolting " and is more likely to happen when there 's extra sunshine .
You 'll notice that if you leave the flowers , the plant will become lanky and the leaves wo n't be as full or tasty .
4 Watch for pests and mold .
Basil plants are attractive to Japanese beetles
the best way to control these pests is to pick them off the plants by hand .
If your plants show signs of mold growth , they may not be getting adequate sunlight , or they may be too close together .
Weed out the smaller plants to give the larger ones more space .
Method 3 of 3 : Harvesting and Using Basil
1 Harvest and prune .
As the plant matures , pinch off the top two pairs of leaves once a stalk reaches a reasonable height .
If you look closely , at the base of every leaf are two tiny little leaves that will grow outwards if the stem growing between them is cut off .
Cut close to those tiny leaves , but be sure not to damage them .
Pinching encourages the plant 's energy to be directed into its stronger stems and leaves .
This helps the plants grow bushy .
Do n't pinch on the lower part of the stem , or the basil plants will grow tall and reedy .
You want them to get bushy , so pinch from the top .
2 Enjoy the basil fresh .
Rinse off the leaves and use the basil to make pesto or a Caprese salad with tomatoes and fresh mozzarella cheese .
3 Store the basil in the refrigerator .
You 'll probably have more basil than you could possibly eat fresh , so plan on storing some in the fridge .
Wash the leaves , dry them well , and wrap them in paper towels .
Place them in a food storage container with an airtight lid .
4 Freeze the basil .
Freezing the leaves whole does n't work very well , but if you puree it first you can freeze it for months .
Place the basil in a blender with a little water .
Puree it until smooth , then put it in a food storage bag and freeze until you need it .
Wikinews interviews New York bar owner on Santorum cocktail
Thursday , March 15 , 2012
Wikinews interviewed one of the owners of a New York City bar about a popular new politically-themed cocktail drink called Santorum .
The beverage was inspired by the santorum neologism coined in advice columnist Dan Savage 's column Savage Love in response to comments made by former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum about homosexuality ;
Savage 's readers voted to define santorum as ; " the frothy mixture of lube and fecal matter that is sometimes the byproduct of anal sex . "
Background
The santorum neologism has inspired satirical forms of parody , including this political cartoon by Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal webcomic artist Zach Weiner .
2012 .

The Pacific Standard bar is located in Brooklyn , New York , and is co-owned by Jonathan M. Stan and John-Christian G. Rauschenberg .
Stan commented on the creation of the Santorum cocktail , " When he was winning in the polls , I thought , ' OK , I 'll do a Santorum ' . "
Regarding how long the beverage will be made available , Stan remarked to The Brooklyn Paper , " We 'll keep it around until he ’s irrelevant . I hope he ’s there the whole way " .
The main ingredients of the Santorum drink include vodka of an orange citrus variety , Baileys Irish Cream , and Angostura bitters .
It is served in a cocktail glass and topped with Godiva chocolate flakes .
The beverage is priced at US $ 8.00 , and upon an order for it , the bartender will recount for the customer the definition of the santorum neologism .
Troy Patterson of Slate Magazine ventured over to Pacific Standard to sample the new santorum cocktail at the bar .
After tasting the beverage , Patterson observed , " My Santorum was sweet but balanced , with a subtle citrus pucker " .
[ The santorum neologism is ] offensive beyond , you know , anything that any public figure or anybody in America should tolerate , and the mainstream media laughs about it . — Rick Santorum
In a 2003 interview with the Associated Press , Rick Santorum compared legalizing same-sex marriage in the United States to supporting bestiality .
Readers of the Savage Love advice column selected a new definition for the Senator ’s last name , and Savage created a website SpreadingSantorum.com to promulgate the spread of the phenomenon .
The term became a prominent result in searches online , and gained dominance on Web search engines including Google , Bing , and Yahoo! .
Rick Santorum himself has acknowledged and discussed the existence and prevalence of the santorum neologism phenomenon ; he was quoted by The Canadian Press on his assessment of Google 's response ;
" To have a business allow that type of filth to be purveyed through their website or through their system is something that they say they ca n't handle .
I suspect that 's not true . "
Santorum criticized the response of the press to the phenomenon in a 2011 radio interview , saying , " It 's offensive beyond , you know , anything that any public figure or anybody in America should tolerate , and the mainstream media laughs about it . "

Interview
What inspired you to create a cocktail after the santorum neologism ?
Santorum the person has been in the news throughout the primary season , and we thought it would be interesting to try to create a delicious drink that mimicked the appearance of the Dan Savage meaning of " santorum . "
How did you first hear about the definition of the santorum neologism that grew out of the contest from the Savage Love advice column ?
We do n't really remember .
It 's been around forever .
Probably read about it somewhere .
What are your thoughts about Rick Santorum ’s views on gay rights ?
It 's not for us to take a stand on any political issues .
We 'll leave that to the professionals .
Do you think it was an appropriate form of satire for Dan Savage to popularize the definition of the santorum neologism created in his advice column ?
We thought it was funny .
Whether it is appropriate or not is another thing we leave to the pros to decide .
When was the Santorum cocktail first created ?
A few months ago .
What ingredients go in the Santorum cocktail ?
Bailey 's , orange vodka , bitters , and chocolate flakes .
How is the Santorum drink made ?
The ingredients are shaken and/or poured into a cocktail glass .
See the pictures .
Your Santorum cocktail creation has already received media coverage from publications including ; The Brooklyn Paper , The New York Times , Jezebel , Metro.us , EDGE on the Net , and Instinct Magazine .
Did you think when you created it that the Santorum cocktail would receive this news coverage ?
Not at all .
We were just trying to come up with a topical and funny new cocktail for our customers to laugh about and enjoy .
What culinary dishes would you recommend that go well with the Santorum cocktail ?
You 'd probably be having the cocktail at dessert time , so something sweet ; ice cream or pie .
Is the drink popular ?
How many times do you suppose you ’ve served it at your establishment since its creation ?
The drink was mildly popular for the last few months , but of course has become a great deal more popular since getting all this publicity .
We have no way to estimate how many times we 've served it overall , but we 're now pouring around ten a night .
1 Introduction
Tenured and tenure-track university faculty play a special role in determining the speed and direction of scientific progress , both directly through their research and indirectly through their training of new researchers .
Past studies establish that each of these efforts is strongly and positively influenced through various forms of faculty diversity , including ethnic , racial , and gender diversity .
As an example , research shows that greater diversity within a community or group can lead to improved critical thinking [ 1 ] and more creative solutions to complex tasks [ 2 , 3 ] by pairing together individuals with unique skillsets and perspectives that complement and often augment the abilities of their peers .
Additionally , diversity has been shown to produce more supportive social climates and effective learning environments [ 4 ] , which can facilitate the mentoring of young scientists .
Despite these positive effects , however , quantifying the impact of diversity in science remains exceedingly difficult , due in large part to a lack of comprehensive data about the scientific workforce .
Measuring the composition and dynamics of a scientific workforce , particularly in a rapidly expanding field like computer science , is a crucial first step toward understanding how scholarly research is conducted and how it might be enhanced .
For many scientific fields , however , there is no central listing of all tenure-track faculty , making it difficult to define a rigorous sample frame for analysis .
Further , rates of adoption of services like GoogleScholar and ResearchGate vary within , and across disciplines .
For instance , gender representation in computing is an important issue with broad implications [ 5 ] , but without a full census of computing faculty , the degree of inequality and its possible sources are difficult to establish [ 6 ] .
Some disciplines , like political science , are organized around a single professional society , whose membership roll approximates a full census [ 7 ] .
Most fields , on the other hand , including computer science , lack a single all-encompassing organization and membership information is instead distributed across many disjoint lists , such as web-based faculty directories for individual departments .
Because assembling such a full census is difficult , past studies have tended to avoid this task and have instead used samples of researchers [ 8 – 11 ] , usually specific to a particular field [ 12 – 16 ] , and often focused on the scientific elite [ 17 , 18 ] .
Although useful , such samples are not representative of the scientific workforce as a whole and thus have limited generalizability .
One of the largest census efforts to date assembled , by hand , a nearly complete record of three academic fields : computer science , history , and business [ 19 ] .
This data set has shed considerable light on dramatic inequalities in faculty training , placement , and scholarly productivity [ 6 , 19 , 20 ] .
But , this data set is only a single snapshot of an evolving and expanding system and hence offers few insights into the changing composition and diversity trends within these academic fields .
In some fields , yearly data on faculty numbers and composition are available in aggregate .
In computer science , the Computing Research Association ( CRA ) documents trends in the employment of PhD recipients through the annual Taulbee survey of computing departments in North America ( cra.org/resources/taulbee-survey ) .
Such surveys can provide valuable insight into trends and summary statistics on the scientific workforce but suffer from two key weaknesses .
First , surveys are subject to variable response rates and the misinterpretation of questions or sample frames , which can inject bias into fine-grained analyses [ 21 , 22 ] .
Second , aggregate information provides only a high-level view of a field , which can make it difficult to investigate causality [ 23 ] .
For example , differences in recruitment and retention strategies across departments will be washed out by averaging , thereby masking any insights into the efficacy of individual strategies and policies .
Here , we present a novel system , based on a topical web crawler , that can quickly and automatically assemble a full census of an academic field using digital data available on the public World Wide Web .
This system is efficient and accurate , and it can be adapted to any academic discipline and used for continuous collection .
The system is capable of collecting census data for an entire academic field in just a few hours using off-the-shelf computing hardware , a vast improvement over the roughly 1600 hours required to do this task by hand [ 19 ] .
By assembling an accurate census of an entire field from online information alone , this system will facilitate new research on the composition of academic fields by providing access to complete faculty listings , without having to rely on surveys or professional societies .
This system can also be used longitudinally to study how the workforce ’s composition changes over time , which is particularly valuable for evaluating the effectiveness of policies meant to broaden participation or improve retention of faculty .
Finally , applied to many academic fields in parallel , the system can elucidate scientists ’ movement between different disciplines and relate those labor flows to scientific advances .
In short , many important research questions will benefit from the availability of accurate and frequently-recollected census data .
Our study is organized as follows .
We begin by detailing the design and implementation of our web crawler framework .
Next , we present the results of our work in two sections .
The first demonstrates the validity and utility of the crawler by collecting census data for the field of computer science and comparing it to a hand-curated census , collected in 2011 [ 19 ] .
The second provides an example of the type of research enabled by our system and uses the 2011 and 2017 censuses to investigate the “ leaky pipeline ” problem in faculty retention .
Understand
Some of the distinctive skyline of Downtown , including the Kaiser Building and the Cathedral of Christ the Light .
Often overshadowed by San Francisco , its larger neighbor lying directly to the west , Oakland has in recent years began to step out from under the shadows , playing upon the beautiful highlights of its own and its rise as the multicultural " hipster ' city of the Bay Area .
Since the 1960s , Oakland has been a hub of radical culture , and is the birthplace of both the Black Panther Party and the Hell 's Angels .
Oakland 's history in the arts and entertainment arena is notable as well , as Oakland has nurtured or been a second home to novelists Gertrude Stein , Jack London , Amy Tan , and Maya Angelou ; actors Meryl Streep , Mark Hamill , Bruce Lee , and Tom Hanks ; architect Julia " Butterfly " Hill ; classical conductor Calvin Simmons ; rappers MC Hammer , 2Pac , Messy Marv , and several other notables in the liberal arts and sciences .
Oakland as a city reflects the amazing diversity of its residents and long history .
For many visitors , the first place they are likely to visit is Downtown , especially if they are in town on business , or simply do not know where to start .
The center of transportation by BART and by bus is there , if one wants to branch out .
And it is as simple as walking in a direction from there , for the first few neighborhoods , since Old Oakland is along 10th Street , just west of Broadway .
Just east of Broadway and continuing north and south is Oakland 's famous Chinatown , and that to get the real essence of " Chinatown , " Oakland rather than San Francisco is your best bet .
Many of the buildings and streets of Chinatown reflect the diverse nature of its history , in architecture and in the bilingual signs seen throughout the neighborhood .
The curious traveler can venture to take a bus southwards along Broadway , and come to Jack London Square .
The unlikely mixture of warehouses and very expensive restaurants and posh atmosphere alongside some of the landmarks of the city 's waterfront makes the Square an interesting place to visit and explore , even for locals .
It 's the home of the USS Potomac and the site of the namesake author 's residence , still preserved and humbly standing not far from a saloon from the same era .
Just west of Downtown and slightly north of the Financial District is Uptown .
In the evening it buzzes with art galleries , theaters and residents and Bay Area visitors coming into the area to see concerts .
A popular area on the weekend with a mixed vibe of hipster and hip hop .
It 's a burgeoning neighborhood of performing arts ranging from nightclubs to music halls , avant-garde performance art , and even an improv theater company .
Uptown also has some of the best in the city 's vintage architecture , like the Gothic Revival Cathedral Building and the Art Deco Fox and Paramount Theaters , as well as several restaurants .
North Oakland is a sweeping term , referring to just about everywhere north of Uptown and Lake Merritt .
Many of the neighborhoods are commercial centers and absolute heaven for foodies or those who seek quieter surroundings than the hustle and bustle of Downtown and Chinatown .
Temescal is a neighborhood that lies north-northwest from Downtown , centered along the reach of Telegraph Avenue , at and near 51st Street .
Until the 1960s , a dominantly Italian-American neighborhood , it is now a much more diversified neighborhood , home to many restaurants , including some of the city 's best Korean and Ethiopian establishments .
Northeast of Temescal and near the Berkeley border lies Rockridge , a neighborhood mixed with family friendly and artistic vibes .
It has lots of local boutiques and a diverse range of food at all prices and styles .
Open-air markets , bookstores , and a BART station all its own make Rockridge another of many pleasant stops in North Oakland .
South of Rockridge , and southeast of Temescal lies Piedmont Avenue , a street extending from Broadway near 34th and Hawthorne and an area with a group of hospitals on a hill ( Pill Hill ) up and through a neighborhood bordered on both sides by picturesque hills , houses and trees .
Another of North Oakland 's group of foodie spots , home to the city 's single Michelin-rated restaurant and many others ; cafes , ice cream , coffee shops and pleasant walks complete the vision of this interesting and quiet neighborhood .
East along I-580 and not far from Piedmont Avenue are two neighborhoods separated by a couple of blocks .
Grand Lake and Lakeshore both share a friendly , suburban sort of feel .
The Grand Lake Theater stands at the entrance to the neighborhood that bears its name , a matter of a few hundred feet from Lakeshore Avenue – both are diverse neighborhoods no matter what your budget , be it burgers or sandwiches or a full romantic evening , either of these twin-sister neighborhoods will make a pleasant time , by day or night .
West Oakland was once a burgeoning working-class neighborhood with its roots tracing as far back as the opening decades of the 19th century .
It has seen a period of decline between the 1960s and the more recent past .
Strangely , twice in its history the neighborhood has seen benefits from major earthquakes .
After the 1906 earthquake , many San Franciscans relocated there , and the industrial development of the 20s and 30s saw its population in the hundreds of thousands .
With Loma Prieta in 1989 , the effective barrier of the Cypress Street Overpass was destroyed , and the decades since have seen the rebuilding and refurbishing of many of the neighborhood 's original Victorian houses , and there is a burgeoning performing arts community growing near the center of the neighborhood .
Though there are a few draws for the traveler , West Oakland is dominantly a very poor working-class residential neighborhood with a less than spectacular reputation .
Digital Humanities Clinics -
Leading Dutch Librarians into DH
Michiel Cock m.p.cock@vu.nl Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam , the Netherlands
Lotte Wilms lotte.wilms@kb.nl National Library of the Netherlands , the Netherlands
In 2015 , an initiative was started to set up a Dutch speaking DH+Lib community in the Netherlands and Belgium , based on the example of the American communal space of librarians , archivists , LIS graduate students , and information specialists to discuss topics ‘ Where the Digital Humanities and Libraries meet ’ .
At the initial meeting it became apparent that most participants were there to learn more about digital humanities and were not ( yet ) in the situation where they were able to offer expertise on the subject .
On the administrative level , the directors of the libraries participating in the consortium of Dutch academic libraries ( UKB ) also expressed the wish that librarians become more fluent in DH .
A year later , the National Library of the Netherlands ( Koninklijke Bibliotheek ) , and the University Library of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam again concluded that librarians at their institutes who wanted to get involved in DH needed more training to adequately support researchers and students in this field .
Therefore both institutes joined forces to develop a set of clinics on DH for librarians .
The two institutes were later joined by the Leiden University Libraries .
We see this as the ideal opportunity to provide these educative sessions not only to our own librarians , but also to the academic librarians of other Dutch research libraries .
In essence , we want to teach our country ’s librarians the ins and outs of DH in order for them to take up their natural role of facilitating and supporting research and ideally become the research partner needed in DH projects .
The aim of these clinics is to provide basic methodological competencies and technical skills in DH , for a diverse group of librarians , consisting of both subject and technical librarians with basic technical skills .
The content of these sessions should enable them to provide services to researchers and students , identify remaining gaps in knowledge or skills that they could address by self-directed learning and ( perhaps ) to automate their daily library work .
We are not setting out to turn them into programmers or data crunchers , but want to boost their knowledge level to where they feel comfortable providing information about DH projects , follow the literature and research , follow online tutorials and hopefully take up the challenge of finishing this professional development by engaging with the DH community .
In order to design this curriculum we follow a four step approach with a Working Out Loud - principle ( Williams , 2010 ) :
Desk research about what being a DH librarian entails ( e.g. Hartsell-Gundy et al. , 2015 ; Mulligan , 2016 ; also see the Zotero library of the LIBER Digital Humanities working group ) ;
Identify possible subjects , based on experience , a comparison of existing teaching material related to DH ( e.g. The Programming Historian , the Digital Scholarship Training Programme at the British Library and Columbia University 's Developing Librarian project ) and the TaDiRAH taxonomy of research activities ;
Get feedback from researchers on possible subjects , based on the knowledge and skills they feel librarians need ;
Get feedback from librarians on possible subjects , based on already known gaps in their knowledge and skills .
With these in hand , we will design the curriculum of clinics , based on the method of ' constructive alignment ' ( Biggs et al. , 2011 ) , to make sure that the intended learning objectives and the teaching / learning activities stay aligned .
Our plan is to organize a maximum of 6 clinics , each one full day .
Each day starts with one or more lectures by researchers , that address the conceptual knowledge needed .
The afternoon sessions will be devoted to the hands-on training of skills , following the Library Carpentry model as closely as possible .
By having researchers provide the lecture sessions , we hope to fuel the enthusiasm of the librarians with the inspiration of direct contact with researchers and to provide access to a network within and across universities .
With these clinics , we hope to initiate a stream of DH activities in Dutch universities , making access to support easier for new digital scholars .
The poster at DH2017 will present the curriculum , its position in the international context and offer the lessons learned from both the design process and the first clinics .
We welcome discussion about our efforts and the possibilities of applying this in other contexts .

Due to its remarkable biodiversity , with over a third of the local plant species found nowhere else , Socotra has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site .
With over 40,000 inhabitants , though , it 's not just a nature reserve .
The Island is new to tourism , so if you are looking for a luxurious vacation this is not the right destination .
However , Socotra is a perfect destination for the adventurous and nature loving travelers .
Socotra takes pride in their eco-tourism and values their spectacular plant and wildlife that may sometimes be only found on this island .
Although the lodging and facilities may not be the same as more modern and developed locations , Socotra is a beautiful and magnificent destination choice .
Great care is shown to both guests and the environment .
Socotra is an eco-tourism system with limited infrastructure and new to the international tourist market , and therefore the hotel accommodations are not quite like other destinations .
However there are four hotels in Hadibo : Taj Socotra Hotel , Hafijj Hotel , Socotra Hotel , and Summer land Hotel .
These hotels may not be the most luxerious , but they do provide air-conditionting , televisions , and refrigerators in all of the rooms .
Most of the rooms at these hotels have their own bathroom , but there are a few rooms at the Hafijj Hotel and Socotra Hotel that must share bathrooms .
Fortunately , there is a restaurant in each of the hotels with simple yet delicious cuisine .
Considering Socotra is a fairly new eco-tourism destination , their facilities are decent .
In addition , there is also another hotel at the airport as well as multiple guest houses around the island .
The most popular lodging is actually camping on the beaches .
There are several campsites that allow tourists to barbeque on the beach with beautiful mountain views in the background .
Tourists can choose to purchase camping tour packages which include a driver or guide that will show tourists around the beaches as well as provide meals during their stay .
It is a fantastic way to enjoy the beauty and wildlife of the island .
A runway that provides fairly regular airline transportation was only constructed in 1999 .
Like everything else , infrastructure and transportation has only just begun in recent years .
There are also plans for new harbor facilities that will allow fisherman to sell and catch more easily and make importing food and fuel simpler .
In addition , there are also two information centers located at the airport and Hadibo .
When to go : Climate is an important consideration .
And this depends on your interest .
Nature enthusiasts should go from early October to late April .
The monsoon occurs in July till mid-August ( during July in the south east and south west of the island , wind surfing activity can be arranged ) .
Generally , wildlife and natural viewing is best from the end of January through May .
Get in
By plane
Dixam , in the centre of the island
There are flights from Sana'a via Al Mukalla .
Yemenia Airlines offers one flight per week on Thursday morning .
Felix Airways offers two flights per week on Wednesday afternoon and Saturday morning .

Socotra is considered the jewel of biodiversity in the Arabian Sea .
Although the region is small , it is characterized by unique land and marine biodiversity .
The interior of the island is dominated by the beautiful and green Hagghier mountains and limestone plateau .
While on the outer coastline , breathtaking natural beaches have pure white sand dunes and palm trees .
Socotra Island is very rich and is home to many rare spectacular species of reefs , fish , birds , plants , and trees which are not found anywhere else in the world .
The limestone plateau and the Hagghier Mountains are the richest areas for endemic plant species , but endemics are found throughout the island in every type of vegetation .
One of the most famous plants is the dragon 's blood tree “ dracaena cinnabara ” which exists only on Socotra and nowhere else on the Earth .
The tree got its name because if any damage is made to the bark then a dark red liquid oozes out .
The dragon 's blood tree thrives in Socotra 's arid climate
There is also the Desert Rose ( adenium obesium ) which looks like a blooming elephant leg .
Also found in Socotra 's landscape is the ever-strange and extremely rare Cucumber Tree .
In addition there are over 120 species of birds and about 190 species of butterflies .
There is so much beauty all around the island , it is difficult not the appreciate to magnificent scenery and wildlife .
How to Prepare Quinoa
Quinoa is known as the little rice of Peru .
The Incas treated the crop as sacred and referred to quinoa as " chisaya mama " or " mother of all grains . " [ 1 ]
By tradition , the Inca emperor would sow the first seeds of the season using " golden implements . "
Quinoa is rich in protein and much lighter than other grains .
It is much easier to prepare than rice and is rapidly gaining in popularity , especially among vegetarians who value its high protein levels .
Ingredients
1 cup quinoa
2 cups water ( or broth )
Olive oil to taste ( Optional )
1/2 teaspoon salt ( Optional )
Method 1 Cooking On A Stove Top
Rinse the grains of quinoa in water .
You can skip this step if you have purchased pre-rinsed quinoa in a box .
To rinse , place the measured grain in a strainer under running water for a few minutes .
This is necessary to remove the excess saponins on the outside of the grains which impart a bitter flavor to quinoa if not removed .
Toast quinoa in a saucepan ( optional ) .
Drizzle a bit of olive oil in a pan over medium-high heat .
Add the quinoa and cook for about 1 minute .
This brings out quinoa 's nutty flavor .
Cook the quinoa .
Place two parts water or stock to one part of quinoa in a saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to a boil .
Cover and reduce heat to low .
Simmer the quinoa for about 15 minutes or until the grain becomes translucent and the white germ forms a visible spiral on the exterior of the quinoa grain .
Try to ensure there is an al dente bite to the germ , in the same way as pasta .
Quinoa will continue cooking for a bit even after you take it off the heat .
Take the quinoa off the heat and let stand , covered , for 5 minutes .
This will give it time to absorb any moisture that might still be in the pan .
Uncover and fluff with a fork .
The quinoa should look light and fluffy , and you should be able to see the germ separating from the seed .
Serve .
Freshly cooked quinoa should be served immediately to retain nutritional value and a good flavor .
Serve with :
Stir-fry , using the quinoa as a substitute for rice .
Curry .
Braised meat .
In a salad .
Virtually any other combination you can think of !
Method 2 Cooking In a Rice Cooker
Rinse 1 cup of quinoa in a fine mesh sieve under cold water .
If you bought packaged quinoa , this step is n't always necessary , but it 's better to be safe than sorry .
Pour quinoa into rice cooker .
One option is to toast the quinoa before placing in the rice cooker .
See Step # 2 in Method One above for directions .
Add 2 cups of liquid and 1/2 teaspoon of salt into the rice cooker .
Water , chicken stock or broth , or vegetable stock all work .
Cook for approximately 15 minutes .
Some rice cooker will have different settings instead of a simple " cook " option .
Try the " white rice " option if your rice cooker gives you several options .
Let stand for about 5 minutes .
Fluff with a fork and serve .
Method 3 Cooking In the Oven
Preheat oven to 350 ° F ( 177 ° C ) .
Arrange rack in the middle of the oven .
Rinse quinoa thoroughly in a fine mesh seive under cold water .
In a medium saucepan , heat up 2 tablespoons vegetable oil over medium-low heat .
Add onions , peppers , mushrooms , or any other type of desired vegetable or herb into the saucepan ( optional ) .
Cook onions until they are translucent , but not burned .
Sweat the peppers or vegetables along with the onions .
Add the quinoa and salt to the saucepan , stirring until completely incorporated .
This should take no longer than 30 seconds .
Add one cup of broth and one cup of water to the saucepan and bring to a boil over medium high heat .
Once a boil is reached , transfer quinoa to a 8-by-8-inch baking dish . [ 2 ]
Spread out quinoa evenly and cover baking dish completely with aluminum foil .
Cook the quinoa in the oven for roughly 20 minutes , or until most of the liquid is gone .
Remove the aluminum foil from the baking dish , add cheese or other seasonings , and bake for an additional 5 minutes .
After 5 minutes , the quinoa should be fully cooked .
Serve and enjoy !
Phoenix
Phoenix is the capital of the state of Arizona as well as the most populous city in the American Southwest and sixth largest city in the United States .
Founded in 1871 , it has become the region 's primary political , cultural , economic , and transportation center .
At an elevation of 1100 ft ( 335 m ) , it is situated in the biologically unique Sonoran Desert .
Over time it has merged with the neighboring cities of Scottsdale , Tempe , Glendale , Peoria , Chandler , and Gilbert to form the Greater Phoenix Metropolitan Area .
Currently exurbs such as Apache Junction , Fountain Hills , Queen Creek , and Sun City are becoming part of this metropolitan area as well .
Phoenix is extremely hot and dry in the summertime , so always have sunscreen with you !
Understand
Why would anybody want to start a city in the middle of a desert ?
The answer is , surprisingly , agriculture .
The Salt and Verde Rivers of central Arizona were exploited for large-scale agriculture by Native Americans as early as the 11th century .
The area that now encompasses Phoenix was a center of the Hohokam culture , which built large canal systems and a network of towns and villages , whose remains may be viewed in the city to this day .
White settlers discovered the remnants of the Hohokam culture in the 19th century .
The city 's name reflects its history as a city " reborn from the ashes " of the previous settlement .
European-American settlement of the area commenced in the 1860s , and in 1911 the completion of the first of several large reservoirs in the mountains north and east of Phoenix insured its success as a center for irrigation-based agriculture .
Many tens of thousands of acres were planted in citrus and cotton and other crops , and for many years , intensive , year-round irrigated agriculture formed the basis of the economy .
Recent years are seeing a revival , and trendy hotels , bars , shops and restaurants are making it a place to be again .
Warm and sunny winter weather also ensured a thriving tourism industry , and encouraged many Easterners and Midwesterners to relocate to Phoenix .
High-tech industry began to flourish after World War II , and since that time the growth of Phoenix has been explosive .
As a result , a population of just over 100,000 in 1950 has given way to a 2014 estimate of 1,537,058 ( with the metro area estimated at 4,489,109 ) .
Climate
Phoenix has an arid climate with long , hot summers and very mild winters .
It has the highest average temperature of any metropolitan area in the States .
The weather varies enormously from one season to the next .
While it 's not as cold as in the northern states during the winter , it does freeze sometimes , and temperatures in the 30s ° F ( that 's around or slightly above 0 ° C ) are not unheard of .
In the summer , very hot and dry heat is the norm .
On the hottest days , it can get up to 115 ° F ( 46 ° C ) or more .
Monsoon rains with lightning occur regularly from July to September during the late afternoon and evening , occasionally overnight also .
April is the most ideal month .
In some neighborhoods , cicada insects make loud sounds from sunset to sunrise .
Talk
English is the dominant language in Phoenix .
However , like much of the Southwest with a large Hispanic population , Spanish is very widely spoken in Phoenix .
Spanish is a language often used for day-to-day discourse in many places , although English is the language of preference , especially when dealing with businesses and government .

How to Stop Procrastinating
If you 're a chronic procrastinator , you know the pain and stress that comes with putting things off .
Although you may have the desire to accomplish something , getting the motivation to do it is a different matter .
Fortunately , overcoming your procrastination is easy to do when you put your mind to it .
Side note : If you have anything due right now , and you have n't finished it , leave this article and complete that work .
Steps
Create a to-do list .
Yes , make yourself an old fashioned to-do list with check boxes and everything .
List everything , big and small , that you have to do for your entire day ; break big activities into smaller bits if necessary .
Then , as you work through your day , check off each of the items on your list .
You will feel a growing sense of pride as you visually monitor your ever-diminishing list of projects .
Focus your list on including the things you typically put off , not the things you are sure to do on a regular basis .
If necessary , set time-frames for your items to be done by .
For example , list “ take the dog for a walk by 12:30 ” rather than simply “ walk the dog . ”
Re-evaluate your list halfway through your day to rank your items based on highest priority .
Then , tackle the most important ones before looking back at the smaller things to do .
Keep a notebook by hand before you start your workday .
Write every thought down that comes up during work .
Every single to do or things you want to do at that specific moment .
Do n't do it , put it on a list and do it later .
This prevents you from getting into the " procrastination zone . "
Finish the hard stuff .
When you have a looming project that 's bogging you down and making you unproductive in other areas , tackle it first .
Finishing the largest item on your list of things to do will make you feel extra productive and give you the boost to do other things you ’ve been pushing to the side .
If your “ big project ” is something that ca n’t be done in one sitting , make a list of small parts of it that you can accomplish today .
Do n’t worry about completing the entire thing , but take steps now so that doing so in the future is a breeze .
Make an ultimate to-do list for this single project , and have it placed somewhere you will see it on a regular basis .
As you mark things off , you will be motivated to continue doing so , and seeing it on a regular basis will remind you that your project needs to be done .
Do two-minute tasks .
Whenever you are presented with something that you do n’t want to do or would consider putting off , ask yourself , “ will this take me less than two minutes to finish ? ”
For many of us , this includes small chores , like taking out the trash or pulling a few weeds , but can include simple tasks in all areas of life .
Anything that you want to put off but takes two minutes to do - do it .
Simply force yourself to use the next 120 seconds to be productive and do the duty you normally would push off for hours or days . [ 1 ] .
Create a timed work frenzy .
If you find yourself being pulled off into the depths of daydreams , set a period of time to do nothing but work .
Take ten minutes and remove all distractions - your phone , magazines , or thoughts of your attractive love - and go into a working frenzy .
Force yourself to work productively for ten minutes , and then go back to whatever it was you were doing .
Chances are , you ’ll get into a groove and keep working at a high pace even when your frenzy time is out .
Working with a timer is generally regarded by most experts as being one of the best ways to develop self-discipline and stop procrastination .
The most famous method of working to strict time controls ( known as time-boxing ) involves creating a list of tasks .
Each task is then assigned an exact amount of time to complete .
If you do n't finish the task in the allotted time , then you move on to the next one .
Using this work arrangement , it forces you to take action , as you ca n't afford to waste any time . [ 2 ] .
Give yourself a break .
If you ca n’t seem to focus and are working half-heartedly at your tasks , give yourself a brief break .
Set a timer for ten minutes , and take a nap , read a book , or call your friend .
Do whatever it is you ’ve been daydreaming about so that the temptation is removed once you get back to work .
Just be sure to follow through with your deadline rather than ignoring it when your alarm finally goes off .
Athens ( Greek : Αθήνα , Athína ) , is the capital city of Greece with a metropolitan population of 3.7 million inhabitants .
It is in many ways the birthplace of Classical Greece , and therefore of Western civilization .
Understand
Old Athens
The first pre-historic settlements was constructed in 3000 BC around the hill of Acropolis .
The legend says that the King of Athens , Theseus unified the ten tribes of early Athens into one kingdom ( c. 1230 BC ) .
This process of synoikismos – bringing together in one home – created the largest and wealthiest state on the Greek mainland , but it also created a larger class of people excluded from political life by the nobility .
By the 7th century BC , social unrest had become widespread , and the Areopagus appointed Draco to draft a strict new law code ( hence " draconian " ) .
When this failed , they appointed Solon , with a mandate to create a new constitution ( 594 ) .
This was the great beginning of a new social revolution , which was the result of the democracy under Clisthenes ( 508 BC ) .
During the Middle Ages , Athens experienced a decline , but re-emerged under Byzantian rule .
Athens was thriving and prosperous during the Crusades , actually benefiting from the Italian trade during this period .
However , this fruitful period was short-lived , as Greece suffered badly under the Ottoman Empire , only to recover in the 19th century as the capital of independent Greece .
Modern Olympic Games
Athens hosted the 2004 Summer Olympic Games .
While most of the sporting venues were located outside the city proper - in various locations throughout Attica - the entire urban area of Athens underwent major lasting changes that have improved the quality of life for visitors and residents alike .
Aside from the excellent transportation infrastructure that was completed in time for the 2004 Olympics ( from new freeways to light rail systems ) , the city 's historic center underwent serious renovation .
Most notable among the city 's facelift projects are the Unification of Archaeological Sites - which connects the city 's classical - era ruins and monuments to each other through a network of pleasant pedestrianized streets - and the restoration of the picturesque neoclassical Thissio and Pláka districts .
The ancient Olympic Games took place in Olympia from 776 BCE to 394 AD .
It is a lengthy day trip from Athens to visit Olympia , but quite interesting .
Architecture
Athens was just a small provincial village when it was chosen in the 1830s to serve as the national capital of the modern Greek State .
Although it had a prestigious past , the city 's political , economic , and cultural importance had declined over the centuries , leaving behind only its classical ruins as a reminder of better times .
With the decision to move the national capital from Nafplio to Athens , architects and city planners were hired to build a new city next to the classical ruins , with grand neoclassical homes and public buildings , large city squares , green spaces , and wide avenues , making a conscious , decisive turn from the city 's Ottoman past .
The city regained its importance in Greek civilization , and by 1900 had evolved into a very attractive cosmopolitan city , with abundant neoclassical architecture harking to the nation 's past .
The 20th century however , marked the rapid development of Athens .
The city suffered minor damage during WWII , and suffered extensive urban planning in the decades that followed , as the nation rapidly industrialized and urbanized .
In the 1960s and 1970s , many 19th century neoclassical buildings , often small and private , were demolished to make way for office buildings , often designed by great Greek architects .
The city also expanded outward through rash development , particularly towards the west , as its population grew by absorbing job-seekers from the provinces .
With the onset of the automobile , public officials reduced the city 's public transportation services without foreseeing the traffic gridlock and smog that would menace the city by the 1980s .
By the late 1980s and early 1990s , the city 's reality led to a rude awakening among local and national officials and , coupled with the country 's new found remarkable prosperity , large scale projects began to slowly regenerate the city and undo some of the damages of recent decades .
Over the course of the next 15 years , money was poured into new transportation infrastructure projects , the restoration of surviving neoclassical buildings , the gentrification of the city 's historical center and the renovation of many former industrial areas and the city 's coastline .
The restoration of charming neoclassical buildings in the city 's historical center has been accompanied by the construction of attractive post-modern buildings in newer districts ; both of which have begun to improve the aesthetic essence of the city .
Athens today is ever evolving , forging a brand new identity for the 21st century .
Climate
Spring and late autumn are the best times to visit Athens .
Summer can be extremely hot and dry during heatwaves , but this rarely happens .
Winter is definitely low season , with the occasional rainy or snowy day , but also an ideal time to save money while enjoying the city without countless other travelers and tourists .
Whilst peak traffic hour can be a bit smoggy on the main roads , on most sunny days the skies are azure blue .
The main reason attributed for the pollution of Athens is because the city is enclosed by mountains in a basin which does not let the smog leave .
The government 's ban on diesel vehicles within Athens and the early 1990s initiatives to improve car emissions have greatly contributed to better atmospheric conditions in the basin .
Prologue
" Try to touch the past .
Try to deal with the past .
It 's not real .
It 's just a dream . "
— Ted Bundy
It did n't start out here .
Not with the scramblers or Rorschach , not with Big Ben or Theseus or the vampires .
Most people would say it started with the Fireflies , but they 'd be wrong .
It ended with all those things .
For me , it began with Robert Paglino .
At the age of eight , he was my best and only friend .
We were fellow outcasts , bound by complementary misfortune .
Mine was developmental .
His was genetic : an uncontrolled genotype that left him predisposed to nearsightedness , acne , and ( as it later turned out ) a susceptibility to narcotics .
His parents had never had him optimized .
Those few TwenCen relics who still believed in God also held that one should n't try to improve upon His handiwork .
So although both of us could have been repaired , only one of us had been .
I arrived at the playground to find Pag the center of attention for some half-dozen kids , those lucky few in front punching him in the head , the others making do with taunts of mongrel and polly while waiting their turn .
I watched him raise his arms , almost hesitantly , to ward off the worst of the blows .
I could see into his head better than I could see into my own ; he was scared that his attackers might think those hands were coming up to hit back , that they 'd read it as an act of defiance and hurt him even more .
Even then , at the tender age of eight and with half my mind gone , I was becoming a superlative observer .
But I did n't know what to do .
I had n't seen much of Pag lately .
I was pretty sure he 'd been avoiding me .
Still , when your best friend 's in trouble you help out , right ?
Even if the odds are impossible — and how many eight-year-olds would go up against six bigger kids for a sandbox buddy ? — at least you call for backup .
Flag a sentry .
Something .
I just stood there .
I did n't even especially want to help him .
That did n't make sense .
Even if he had n't been my best friend , I should at least have empathized .
I 'd suffered less than Pag in the way of overt violence ; my seizures tended to keep the other kids at a distance , scared them even as they incapacitated me .
Still .
I was no stranger to the taunts and insults , or the foot that appears from nowhere to trip you up en route from A to B .
I knew how that felt .
Or I had , once .
But that part of me had been cut out along with the bad wiring .
I was still working up the algorithms to get it back , still learning by observation .
Pack animals always tear apart the weaklings in their midst .
Every child knows that much instinctively .
Maybe I should just let that process unfold , maybe I should n't try to mess with nature .
Then again , Pag 's parents had n't messed with nature , and look what it got them : a son curled up in the dirt while a bunch of engineered superboys kicked in his ribs .
In the end , propaganda worked where empathy failed .
Back then I did n't so much think as observe , did n't deduce so much as remember — and what I remembered was a thousand inspirational stories lauding anyone who ever stuck up for the underdog .
So I picked up a rock the size of my fist and hit two of Pag 's assailants across the backs of their heads before anyone even knew I was in the game .
A third , turning to face the new threat , took a blow to the face that audibly crunched the bones of his cheek .
I remember wondering why I did n't take any satisfaction from that sound , why it meant nothing beyond the fact I had one less opponent to worry about .
The rest of them ran at the sight of blood .
One of the braver promised me I was dead , shouted " Fucking zombie ! " over his shoulder as he disappeared around the corner .
Three decades it took , to see the irony in that remark .
Two of the enemy twitched at my feet .
I kicked one in the head until it stopped moving , turned to the other .
Something grabbed my arm and I swung without thinking , without looking until Pag yelped and ducked out of reach .
" Oh , " I said .
" Sorry . "
One thing lay motionless .
The other moaned and held its head and curled up in a ball .
" Oh shit , " Pag panted .
Blood coursed unheeded from his nose and splattered down his shirt .
His cheek was turning blue and yellow .
" Oh shit oh shit oh shit ... "
I thought of something to say .
" You all right ? "
" Oh shit , you — I mean , you never ... "
He wiped his mouth .
Blood smeared the back of his hand .
" Oh man are we in trouble . "
" They started it . "
" Yeah , but you — I mean , look at them ! "
The moaning thing was crawling away on all fours .
I wondered how long it would be before it found reinforcements .
I wondered if I should kill it before then .
" You 'd a never done that before , " Pag said .
Before the operation , he meant .
I actually did feel something then — faint , distant , but unmistakable .
I felt angry .
" They started — "
Pag backed away , eyes wide .
" What are you doing ?
Put that down ! "
I 'd raised my fists .
I did n't remember doing that .
I unclenched them .
It took a while .
I had to look at my hands very hard for a long , long time .
The rock dropped to the ground , blood-slick and glistening .
" I was trying to help . "
I did n't understand why he could n't see that .
" You 're , you 're not the same , " Pag said from a safe distance .
" You 're not even Siri any more . "
" I am too .
Do n't be a fuckwad . "
" They cut out your brain ! "
" Only half .
For the ep — "
" I know for the epilepsy !
You think I do n't know ?
But you were in that half — or , like , part of you was ... "
He struggled with the words , with the concept behind them .
" And now you 're different .
It 's like , your mom and dad murdered you — "
" My mom and dad , " I said , suddenly quiet , " saved my life .
I would have died . "
" I think you did die , " said my best and only friend .
" I think Siri died , they scooped him out and threw him away and you 're some whole other kid that just , just grew back out of what was left .
You 're not the same .
Ever since .
You 're not the same . "
Wikinews interviews Christopher Hill , U.S. Republican Party presidential candidate
Interview
What qualifications do you have that will assist you in executing the duties of president ?
My Presidential qualifications are rooted in my service as an Officer in the United States Air Force .
I took the Oath to our Constitution at 22 years old .
I understood it was an Oath to ALL of our people .
Politicians profess an Oath to this nation but once in office pursue their party agenda and reward their voters .
As President , I will serve ALL of the people in America , guided by the Constitution .
Why run for president ?
Why not run for a lower office that you would be more likely to win and effect change ?
When I was a young man in Air Force ROTC I was chosen to attend a unique Pilot Training Program called Euro- NATO Joint Jet Pilot Training .
The Air Force only selected 180 Officers a year from the Academy , Squadron Officer School and ROTC to attend .
I volunteered for that program because I knew I wanted to be a Fighter Pilot and at the " Top of the Spear . "
In those days it was all or nothing .
If you graduated you were assigned a fighter , if you were not quite fighter pilot material you had no response to fly another aircraft , you were washed out .
Congress has proven itself ineffective as a body .
To make a difference in America you must have the " Bully Pulpit " and speak to the People .
The President has that pulpit .
All or nothing .
I never wanted to make politics a career .
Why did you choose to run in the Republican Party ?
My ties to the Republican party date back to 1979 , when I volunteered for Ronald Reagan and his campaign in New Hampshire .
In those days I believed there was a difference in the parties .
Today , like many Americans , I am skeptical .
I understand third party candidates have no success .
I hope to lead the Republican party in a new direction for working class Americans .
How do you plan to get into the Republican debates and make an impact on polls ?
In order to be invited to the debates , we must raise money and poll nationally .
This is an effort that is underway .
Recently we were listed in New Hampshire and nationally with Politics1 .
If you do not receive the Republican nomination , would you consider running as a third party candidate ?
No , I will back the nominee of the Republican party in 2016 .
After that , I may reconsider .
Other than yourself , which candidates have you supported for president in previous campaigns ?
Reagan in 80 and 84 , [ George H. W. ] Bush in 88 and 92 , [ Phil ] Gramm in 96 , [ George W. ] Bush in 2000 and , Romney in 08 .
What are your thoughts on the job Barack Obama has done as president ?
Specifically , what would you have done differently ?
President Obama has an agenda that represents the far left wing of his party .
His use of the Presidency to further this agenda has in many ways been unconstitutional .
Specifically , altering law once it is passed to accommodate his voting blocs .
His direction to Eric Holder to enforce some laws and not others is another example .
Hill at the Lesser-known candidates forum in 2011
If elected , what would constitute a successful presidency for you ?
Achieving four goals :
Term Limits for Congress and the Courts returning government to the People .
Implementing a Tax System that allows working Americans making under $ 250,000 to keep all of their money .
Closing Loopholes and putting in place a system that is transparent and works .
Passing a Living Wage program lifting people out of poverty .
Returning America to a state of Peace and Security .
What individuals would you like to see in a Hill administration ?
I would like to bring People from the heartland of America that make this nation work .
We have had too many decades of Ivy League elites and Professors immersed in theory .

Anything else you would like to add ?
A final thought .
America is a nation that will endure .
I believe it is our responsibility to pass on the same opportunities to future generations that were promised to us .
As President , I intend to keep that promise !
Re(a)d Wedding :
A Comparative Discourse Analysis of Fan Responses to Game of Thrones
It is no exaggeration to say that HBO ’s Game of Thrones is more than just a television series or a successful brand :
it is a transmedia system in the sense first used by Marsha Kinder ( 1991 ) and popularized by Henry Jenkins ( 2006 ) , in which media-hopping networks of intertextualities extend the “ storyworld ” of an original production .
Now spanning six seasons and 60 episodes , with an average global viewership ( from its most recent season ) of 25.1 million viewers per episode ( Shepherd , 2016 ) , it has spawned five video games , a graphic novel adaptation , several companion books , two rap albums , a 28-city orchestral tour , a wide variety of tabletop games , toys , merchandise and mobile apps , and countless podcasts , fanfics and other fan-based creations .
Given the volume of content this represents , it is easy to forget that the television series itself is an adaptation of a book series with a pre-existing fandom .
As such , the Game of Thrones storyworld represents a remarkably rich and challenging environment for fans old and new , who must negotiate an increasingly complex network of paratexts and intertexts in order to fully engage with its narratives .
In this sense , fans of the series represent an emerging model for cultural consumption that should be carefully explored .
Transmedia systems , like that exemplified by Game of Thrones , are becoming increasingly prevalent ( e.g. , Star Wars , Harry Potter , The Walking Dead , the Marvel Cinematic Universe , etc ) ;
these systems demonstrate , in microcosm , the global challenge of managing the fire-hose flow of information in contemporary postdigital society .
The study of how people , as fans , access and manage information within a transmedia system provides valuable insight that contributes not only to practitioners and scholars of the media industry , but to the wider context of cultural studies , by offering findings on this new model of the fan as consumer and information-user .
For us , as digital humanists , defining the “ transmedia fan ” is of particular relevance as we seek to understand contemporary social and cultural transformations engendered by digital technologies .
Methodology
As a first step in defining the “ transmedia fan ” , the current project undertakes a comparative discourse analysis of online conversations of Game of Thrones fans .
One of the most dramatic plot developments in the source material ( Martin , 2000 ) was adapted to the screen in the penultimate episode of the third season , “ The Rains of Castamere ” ( Benioff & Weiss , 2013 ) .
Readers of the book series had long anticipated and dreaded the events of the “ Red Wedding ” , while fans of the show unfamiliar with Martin ’s narrative were largely taken unawares by the pivotal episode .
Since the television series ’ inception , writers at The AV Club have written two critical reviews for each episode :
one for viewers familiar with the books ( i.e. , “ Experts ” ) and one for viewers unfamiliar with the books and averse to “ spoilers ” ( i.e. , “ Newbies ” ) .
What results are two completely separate reviews of “ The Rains of Castamere ” which in turn document the fans ’ reactions to the episode in the form of user comment threads :
one comment thread where fans were expected to be shocked by the outcome of the episode and one comment thread where fans had hotly anticipated it .
As a pilot project , the current work takes the content of both comment threads — a corpus of approximately 5,600 comments — and analyzes each thread separately using a qualitative coding method aligned with constructivist grounded theory ( Charmaz , 2006 ) .
Through this analysis , a categorization of themes emerges illustrating tactics for negotiating intertexts and paratexts unique to each group of fans .
These themes fall under two broad categories :
negotiation ( i.e. , emotional responses ) and tactical negotiation ( i.e. , cognitive , or reasoned responses ) .
A comparison of categories and sub-categories between both groups provides preliminary findings to support an emergent model , or models , of the “ transmedia fan ” .
Conclusion
The present research represents a first step in exploring the impact of transmedia systems , as exemplified by Game of Thrones , through the study of fans .
The question posed by this research is , fundamentally , an examination of how the problem of “ access ” is framed in postdigital society from the perspective of the consumer .
Future research should explore the negotiation tactics observed in transmedia fans using the principles of De Certeau ’s ( 1984 ) everyday life practice , in order to extend its application to the broader context of modern-day consumers .
The current study will contribute to the development of further qualitative and quantitative research that will more clearly define the information behaviors of the transmedia fan .
This project is of relevance to researchers in media studies , fan studies , information studies and digital humanities .
